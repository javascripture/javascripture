# Contributing to JavaScripture

Thanks for your interest in contributing to JavaScripture.

There are many ways to contribute – reporting bugs, feature suggestions, fixing bugs, submitting pull requests for enhancements.

## Reporting Bugs, Asking Questions, Sending Suggestions

We'd love to hear about any issues you have or ideas for new features. You can just [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/scruffian/Javascripture/issues/), or [contact me](http://ben.blog/contact).

## Running JavaScripture Locally

If you’d like to contribute code, first, you will need to run JavaScripture locally. Here is the short version:

1.	Make sure you have git, node and npm installed
2.	Clone this repository locally with git@github.com:scruffian/Javascripture.git
3.	Execute npm start to install packages and start the server
4.	Open http://localhost:7777 in your browser. I find it best to work in Firefox in private mode to avoid caching issues.

## Pull Requests

When you have a patch ready to submit in your local version you need to submit a pull request so it can be reviewed before being merged. Here is a typical workflow:

1. Make sure your local repo is up to date: `git pull`
2. Create a new branch locally and check it out: `git checkout -b branch-name"
3. Add the files you have changed: `git add filename.js`
4. Commit the files: `git commit -m "Commit message goes here"
5. Push your local branch to the remote server: `git push --set-upstream origin branch-name`
6. Open the repo and use the GUI to create and submit a pull request from this branch: https://github.com/scruffian/javascripture
