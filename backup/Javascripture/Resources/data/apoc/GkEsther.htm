The Rest of the Chapters of the Book of Esther
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,4);</script>Then Mardocheus said, God
hath done these things.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,5);</script>For I remember a dream
which I saw concerning these matters, and nothing thereof hath failed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,6);</script>A little fountain
became a river, and there was light, and the sun, and much water: this
river is Esther, whom the king married, and made queen:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,7);</script>And the two dragons
are I and Aman.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,8);</script>And the nations were
those that were assembled to destroy the name of the Jews:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,9);</script>And my nation is this
Israel, which cried to God, and were saved: for the Lord hath saved his
people, and the Lord hath delivered us from all those evils, and God hath
wrought signs and great wonders, which have not been done among the
Gentiles.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,10);</script>Therefore hath he
made two lots, one for the people of God, and another for all the Gentiles.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,11);</script>And these two lots
came at the hour, and time, and day of judgment, before God among all
nations.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,12);</script>So God remembered his
people, and justified his inheritance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,13);</script>Therefore those days
shall be unto them in the month Adar, the fourteenth and fifteenth day of
the same month, with an assembly, and joy, and with gladness before God,
according to the generations for ever among his people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>In the fourth year of
the reign of Ptolemeus and Cleopatra, Dositheus, who said he was a priest
and Levite, and Ptolemeus his son, brought this epistle of Phurim, which
they said was the same, and that Lysimachus the son of Ptolemeus, that was
in Jerusalem, had interpreted it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>In the second year of
the reign of Artexerxes the great, in the first day of the month Nisan,
Mardocheus the son of Jairus, the son of Semei, the son of Cisai, of the
tribe of Benjamin, had a dream;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,3);</script>Who was a Jew, and
dwelt in the city of Susa, a great man, being a servitor in the king’s
court.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,4);</script>He was also one of the
captives, which Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon carried from Jerusalem
with Jechonias king of Judea; and this was his dream:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,5);</script>Behold a noise of a
tumult, with thunder, and earthquakes, and uproar in the land:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,6);</script>And, behold, two great
dragons came forth ready to fight, and their cry was great.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,7);</script>And at their cry all
nations were prepared to battle, that they might fight against the
righteous people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,8);</script>And lo a day of
darkness and obscurity, tribulation and anguish, affliction and great
uproar, upon earth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,9);</script>And the whole
righteous nation was troubled, fearing their own evils, and were ready to
perish.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,10);</script>Then they cried unto
God, and upon their cry, as it were from a little fountain, was made a
great flood, even much water.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,11);</script>The light and the sun
rose up, and the lowly were exalted, and devoured the glorious.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,12);</script>Now when Mardocheus,
who had seen this dream, and what God had determined to do, was awake, he
bare this dream in mind, and until night by all means was desirous to know
it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>And Mardocheus took
his rest in the court with Gabatha and Tharra, the two eunuchs of the
king, and keepers of the palace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,2);</script>And he heard their
devices, and searched out their purposes, and learned that they were about
to lay hands upon Artexerxes the king; and so he certified the king of
them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,3);</script>Then the king examined
the two eunuchs, and after that they had confessed it, they were strangled.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,4);</script>And the king made a
record of these things, and Mardocheus also wrote thereof.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,5);</script>So the king commanded,
Mardocheus to serve in the court, and for this he rewarded him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,6);</script>Howbeit Aman the son
of Amadathus the Agagite, who was in great honour with the king, sought to
molest Mardocheus and his people because of the two eunuchs of the king.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,1);</script>The copy of the
letters was this: The great king Artexerxes writeth these things to the
princes and governours that are under him from India unto Ethiopia in an
hundred and seven and twenty provinces.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,2);</script>After that I became
lord over many nations and had dominion over the whole world, not lifted
up with presumption of my authority, but carrying myself always with
equity and mildness, I purposed to settle my subjects continually in a
quiet life, and making my kingdom peaceable, and open for passage to the
utmost coasts, to renew peace, which is desired of all men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,3);</script>Now when I asked my
counsellors how this might be brought to pass, Aman, that excelled in
wisdom among us, and was approved for his constant good will and steadfast
fidelity, and had the honour of the second place in the kingdom,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,4);</script>Declared unto us, that
in all nations throughout the world there was scattered a certain
malicious people, that had laws contrary to all nations, and continually
despised the commandments of kings, so as the uniting of our kingdoms,
honourably intended by us cannot go forward.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,5);</script>Seeing then we
understand that this people alone is continually in opposition unto all
men, differing in the strange manner of their laws, and evil affected to
our state, working all the mischief they can that our kingdom may not be
firmly established:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,6);</script>Therefore have we
commanded, that all they that are signified in writing unto you by Aman,
who is ordained over the affairs, and is next unto us, shall all, with
their wives and children, be utterly destroyed by the sword of their
enemies, without all mercy and pity, the fourteenth day of the twelfth
month Adar of this present year:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,7);</script>That they, who of old
and now also are malicious, may in one day with violence go into the
grave, and so ever hereafter cause our affairs to be well settled, and
without trouble.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,8);</script>Then Mardocheus
thought upon all the works of the Lord, and made his prayer unto him,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,9);</script>Saying, O Lord, Lord,
the King Almighty: for the whole world is in thy power, and if thou hast
appointed to save Israel, there is no man that can gainsay thee:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,10);</script>For thou hast made
heaven and earth, and all the wondrous things under the heaven.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,11);</script>Thou art Lord of all
things, and and there is no man that can resist thee, which art the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,12);</script>Thou knowest all
things, and thou knowest, Lord, that it was neither in contempt nor pride,
nor for any desire of glory, that I did not bow down to proud Aman.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,13);</script>For I could have been
content with good will for the salvation of Israel to kiss the soles of
his feet.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,14);</script>But I did this, that
I might not prefer the glory of man above the glory of God: neither will I
worship any but thee, O God, neither will I do it in pride.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,15);</script>And now, O Lord God
and King, spare thy people: for their eyes are upon us to bring us to
nought; yea, they desire to destroy the inheritance, that hath been thine
from the beginning.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,16);</script>Despise not the
portion, which thou hast delivered out of Egypt for thine own self.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,17);</script>Hear my prayer, and
be merciful unto thine inheritance: turn our sorrow into joy, that we may
live, O Lord, and praise thy name: and destroy not the mouths of them that
praise thee, O Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,18);</script>All Israel in like
manner cried most earnestly unto the Lord, because their death was before
their eyes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,1);</script>Queen Esther also,
being in fear of death, resorted unto the Lord:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,2);</script>And laid away her
glorious apparel, and put on the garments of anguish and mourning: and
instead of precious ointments, she covered her head with ashes and dung,
and she humbled her body greatly, and all the places of her joy she filled
with her torn hair.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,3);</script>And she prayed unto
the Lord God of Israel, saying, O my Lord, thou only art our King: help
me, desolate woman, which have no helper but thee:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,4);</script>For my danger is in
mine hand.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>From my youth up I
have heard in the tribe of my family that thou, O Lord, tookest Israel
from among all people, and our fathers from all their predecessors, for a
perpetual inheritance, and thou hast performed whatsoever thou didst
promise them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>And now we have sinned
before thee: therefore hast thou given us into the hands of our enemies,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,7);</script>Because we worshipped
their gods: O Lord, thou art righteous.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,8);</script>Nevertheless it
satisfieth them not, that we are in bitter captivity: but they have
stricken hands with their idols,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,9);</script>That they will abolish
the thing that thou with thy mouth hast ordained, and destroy thine
inheritance, and stop the mouth of them that praise thee, and quench the
glory of thy house, and of thine altar,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,10);</script>And open the mouths
of the heathen to set forth the praises of the idols, and to magnify a
fleshly king for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,11);</script>O Lord, give not thy
sceptre unto them that be nothing, and let them not laugh at our fall; but
turn their device upon themselves, and make him an example, that hath
begun this against us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,12);</script>Remember, O Lord,
make thyself known in time of our affliction, and give me boldness, O King
of the nations, and Lord of all power.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,13);</script>Give me eloquent
speech in my mouth before the lion: turn his heart to hate him that
fighteth against us, that there may be an end of him, and of all that are
likeminded to him:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,14);</script>But deliver us with
thine hand, and help me that am desolate, and which have no other help but
thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,15);</script>Thou knowest all
things, O Lord; thou knowest that I hate the glory of the unrighteous, and
abhor the bed of the uncircumcised, and of all the heathen.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,16);</script>Thou knowest my
necessity: for I abhor the sign of my high estate, which is upon mine head
in the days wherein I shew myself, and that I abhor it as a menstruous
rag, and that I wear it not when I am private by myself.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,17);</script>And that thine
handmaid hath not eaten at Aman’s table, and that I have not greatly
esteemed the king’s feast, nor drunk the wine of the drink offerings.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,18);</script>Neither had thine
handmaid any joy since the day that I was brought hither to this present,
but in thee, O Lord God of Abraham.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,19);</script>O thou mighty God
above all, hear the voice of the forlorn and deliver us out of the hands
of the mischievous, and deliver me out of my fear.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,1);</script>And upon the third
day, when she had ended her prayers, she laid away her mourning garments,
and put on her glorious apparel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,2);</script>And being gloriously
adorned, after she had called upon God, who is the beholder and saviour of
all things, she took two maids with her:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,3);</script>And upon the one she
leaned, as carrying herself daintily;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,4);</script>And the other
followed, bearing up her train.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,5);</script>And she was ruddy
through the perfection of her beauty, and her countenance was cheerful and
very amiable: but her heart was in anguish for fear.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,6);</script>Then having passed
through all the doors, she stood before the king, who sat upon his royal
throne, and was clothed with all his robes of majesty, all glittering with
gold and precious stones; and he was very dreadful.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,7);</script>Then lifting up his
countenance that shone with majesty, he looked very fiercely upon her: and
the queen fell down, and was pale, and fainted, and bowed herself upon the
head of the maid that went before her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,8);</script>Then God changed the
spirit of the king into mildness, who in a fear leaped from his throne,
and took her in his arms, till she came to herself again, and comforted
her with loving words and said unto her,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,9);</script>Esther, what is the
matter? I am thy brother, be of good cheer:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,10);</script>Thou shalt not die,
though our our commandment be general: come near.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,11);</script>And so be held up his
golden sceptre, and laid it upon her neck,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,12);</script>And embraced her, and
said, Speak unto me.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,13);</script>Then said she unto
him, I saw thee, my lord, as an angel of God, and my heart was troubled
for fear of thy majesty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,14);</script>For wonderful art
thou, lord, and thy countenance is full of grace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,15);</script>And as she was
speaking, she fell down for faintness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,16);</script>Then the king was
troubled, and all his servants comforted her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,1);</script>The great king
Artexerxes unto the princes and governors of an hundred and seven and
twenty provinces from India unto Ethiopia, and unto all our faithful
subjects, greeting.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,2);</script>Many, the more often
they are honoured with the great bounty of their gracious princes, the
more proud they are waxen,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,3);</script>And endeavour to hurt
not our subjects only, but not being able to bear abundance, do take in
hand to practise also against those that do them good:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,4);</script>And take not only
thankfulness away from among men, but also lifted up with the glorious
words of lewd persons, that were never good, they think to escape the
justice of God, that seeth all things and hateth evil.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,5);</script>Oftentimes also fair
speech of those, that are put in trust to manage their friends’ affairs,
hath caused many that are in authority to be partakers of innocent blood,
and hath enwrapped them in remediless calamities:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,6);</script>Beguiling with the
falsehood and deceit of their lewd disposition the innocency and goodness
of princes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,7);</script>Now ye may see this,
as we have declared, not so much by ancient histories, as ye may, if ye
search what hath been wickedly done of late through the pestilent
behaviour of them that are unworthily placed in authority.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,8);</script>And we must take care
for the time to come, that our kingdom may be quiet and peaceable for all
men,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,9);</script>Both by changing our
purposes, and always judging things that are evident with more equal
proceeding.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,10);</script>For Aman, a
Macedonian, the son of Amadatha, being indeed a stranger from the Persian
blood, and far distant from our goodness, and as a stranger received of us,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,11);</script>Had so far forth
obtained the favour that we shew toward every nation, as that he was
called our father, and was continually honoured of all the next person
unto the king.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,12);</script>But he, not bearing
his great dignity, went about to deprive us of our kingdom and life:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,13);</script>Having by manifold
and cunning deceits sought of us the destruction, as well of Mardocheus,
who saved our life, and continually procured our good, as also of
blameless Esther, partaker of our kingdom, with their whole nation.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,14);</script>For by these means he
thought, finding us destitute of friends to have translated the kingdom of
the Persians to the Macedonians.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,15);</script>But we find that the
Jews, whom this wicked wretch hath delivered to utter destruction, are no
evildoers, but live by most just laws:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,16);</script>And that they be
children of the most high and most mighty, living God, who hath ordered
the kingdom both unto us and to our progenitors in the most excellent
manner.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,17);</script>Wherefore ye shall do
well not to put in execution the letters sent unto you by Aman the son of
Amadatha.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,18);</script>For he that was the
worker of these things, is hanged at the gates of Susa with all his
family: God, who ruleth all things, speedily rendering vengeance to him
according to his deserts.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,19);</script>Therefore ye shall
publish the copy of this letter in all places, that the Jews may freely
live after their own laws.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,20);</script>And ye shall aid
them, that even the same day, being the thirteenth day of the twelfth
month Adar, they may be avenged on them, who in the time of their
affliction shall set upon them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,21);</script>For Almighty God hath
turned to joy unto them the day, wherein the chosen people should have
perished.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,22);</script>Ye shall therefore
among your solemn feasts keep it an high day with all feasting:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,23);</script>That both now and
hereafter there may be safety to us and the well affected Persians; but to
those which do conspire against us a memorial of destruction.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,24);</script>Therefore every city
and country whatsoever, which shall not do according to these things,
shall be destroyed without mercy with fire and sword, and shall be made
not only unpassable for men, but also most hateful to wild beasts and
fowls for ever.
