<h1>
The Second Book of the Maccabees
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>The brethren, the Jews
that be at Jerusalem and in the land of Judea, wish unto the brethren, the
Jews that are throughout Egypt health and peace:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>God be gracious unto
you, and remember his covenant that he made with Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, his faithful servants;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>And give you all an
heart to serve him, and to do his will, with a good courage and a willing
mind;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>And open your hearts in
his law and commandments, and send you peace,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>And hear your prayers,
and be at one with you, and never forsake you in time of trouble.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>And now we be here
praying for you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>What time as Demetrius
reigned, in the hundred threescore and ninth year, we the Jews wrote unto
you in the extremity of trouble that came upon us in those years, from the
time that Jason and his company revolted from the holy land and kingdom,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>And burned the porch,
and shed innocent blood: then we prayed unto the Lord, and were heard; we
offered also sacrifices and fine flour, and lighted the lamps, and set
forth the loaves.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>And now see that ye
keep the feast of tabernacles in the month Casleu.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>In the hundred
fourscore and eighth year, the people that were at Jerusalem and in Judea,
and the council, and Judas, sent greeting and health unto Aristobulus,
king Ptolemeus’ master, who was of the stock of the anointed priests,
and to the Jews that were in Egypt:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>Insomuch as God hath
delivered us from great perils, we thank him highly, as having been in
battle against a king.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>For he cast them out
that fought within the holy city.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>For when the leader
was come into Persia, and the army with him that seemed invincible, they
were slain in the temple of Nanea by the deceit of Nanea’s priests.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>For Antiochus, as
though he would marry her, came into the place, and his friends that were
with him, to receive money in name of a dowry.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>Which when the priests
of Nanea had set forth, and he was entered with a small company into the
compass of the temple, they shut the temple as soon as Antiochus was come
in:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>And opening a privy
door of the roof, they threw stones like thunderbolts, and struck down the
captain, hewed them in pieces, smote off their heads and cast them to
those that were without.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>Blessed be our God in
all things, who hath delivered up the ungodly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>Therefore whereas we
are now purposed to keep the purification of the temple upon the five and
twentieth day of the month Casleu, we thought it necessary to certify you
thereof, that ye also might keep it, as the feast of the tabernacles, and
of the fire, which was given us when Neemias offered sacrifice, after that
he had builded the temple and the altar.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>For when our fathers
were led into Persia, the priests that were then devout took the fire of
the altar privily, and hid it in an hollow place of a pit without water,
where they kept it sure, so that the place was unknown to all men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>Now after many years,
when it pleased God, Neemias, being sent from the king of Persia, did send
of the posterity of those priests that had hid it to the fire: but when
they told us they found no fire, but thick water;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>Then commanded he them
to draw it up, and to bring it; and when the sacrifices were laid on,
Neemias commanded the priests to sprinkle the wood and the things laid
thereupon with the water.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>When this was done,
and the time came that the sun shone, which afore was hid in the cloud,
there was a great fire kindled, so that every man marvelled.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,23);</script>And the priests made a
prayer whilst the sacrifice was consuming, I say, both the priests, and
all the rest, Jonathan beginning, and the rest answering thereunto, as
Neemias did.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,24);</script>And the prayer was
after this manner; O Lord, Lord God, Creator of all things, who art
fearful and strong, and righteous, and merciful, and the only and gracious
King,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,25);</script>The only giver of all
things, the only just, almighty, and everlasting, thou that deliverest
Israel from all trouble, and didst choose the fathers, and sanctify them:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,26);</script>Receive the sacrifice
for thy whole people Israel, and preserve thine own portion, and sanctify
it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,27);</script>Gather those together
that are scattered from us, deliver them that serve among the heathen,
look upon them that are despised and abhorred, and let the heathen know
that thou art our God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,28);</script>Punish them that
oppress us, and with pride do us wrong.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,29);</script>Plant thy people again
in thy holy place, as Moses hath spoken.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,30);</script>And the priests sung
psalms of thanksgiving.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,31);</script>Now when the sacrifice
was consumed, Neemias commanded the water that was left to be poured on
the great stones.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,32);</script>When this was done,
there was kindled a flame: but it was consumed by the light that shined
from the altar.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,33);</script>So when this matter
was known, it was told the king of Persia, that in the place, where the
priests that were led away had hid the fire, there appeared water, and
that Neemias had purified the sacrifices therewith.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,34);</script>Then the king,
inclosing the place, made it holy, after he had tried the matter.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,35);</script>And the king took many
gifts, and bestowed thereof on those whom he would gratify.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,36);</script>And Neemias called
this thing Naphthar, which is as much as to say, a cleansing: but many men
call it Nephi.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>It is also found in the
records, that Jeremy the prophet commanded them that were carried away to
take of the fire, as it hath been signified:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>And how that the
prophet, having given them the law, charged them not to forget the
commandments of the Lord, and that they should not err in their minds,
when they see images of silver and gold, with their ornaments.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>And with other such
speeches exhorted he them, that the law should not depart from their
hearts.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>It was also contained
in the same writing, that the prophet, being warned of God, commanded the
tabernacle and the ark to go with him, as he went forth into the mountain,
where Moses climbed up, and saw the heritage of God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>And when Jeremy came
thither, he found an hollow cave, wherein he laid the tabernacle, and the
ark, and the altar of incense, and so stopped the door.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>And some of those that
followed him came to mark the way, but they could not find it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>Which when Jeremy
perceived, he blamed them, saying, As for that place, it shall be unknown
until the time that God gather his people again together, and receive them
unto mercy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>Then shall the Lord
shew them these things, and the glory of the Lord shall appear, and the
cloud also, as it was shewed under Moses, and as when Solomon desired that
the place might be honourably sanctified.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>It was also declared,
that he being wise offered the sacrifice of dedication, and of the
finishing of the temple.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>And as when Moses
prayed unto the Lord, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the
sacrifices: even so prayed Solomon also, and the fire came down from
heaven, and consumed the burnt offerings.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>And Moses said,
Because the sin offering was not to be eaten, it was consumed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>So Solomon kept those
eight days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>The same things also
were reported in the writings and commentaries of Neemias; and how he
founding a library gathered together the acts of the kings, and the
prophets, and of David, and the epistles of the kings concerning the holy
gifts.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>In like manner also
Judas gathered together all those things that were lost by reason of the
war we had, and they remain with us,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>Wherefore if ye have
need thereof, send some to fetch them unto you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>Whereas we then are
about to celebrate the purification, we have written unto you, and ye
shall do well, if ye keep the same days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>We hope also, that the
God, that delivered all his people, and gave them all an heritage, and the
kingdom, and the priesthood, and the sanctuary,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>As he promised in the
law, will shortly have mercy upon us, and gather us together out of every
land under heaven into the holy place: for he hath delivered us out of
great troubles, and hath purified the place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,19);</script>Now as concerning
Judas Maccabeus, and his brethren, and the purification of the great
temple, and the dedication of the altar,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,20);</script>And the wars against
Antiochus Epiphanes, and Eupator his son,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,21);</script>And the manifest signs
that came from heaven unto those that behaved themselves manfully to their
honour for Judaism: so that, being but a few, they overcame the whole
country, and chased barbarous multitudes,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,22);</script>And recovered again
the temple renowned all the world over, and freed the city, and upheld the
laws which were going down, the Lord being gracious unto them with all
favour:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,23);</script>All these things, I
say, being declared by Jason of Cyrene in five books, we will assay to
abridge in one volume.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,24);</script>For considering the
infinite number, and the difficulty which they find that desire to look
into the narrations of the story, for the variety of the matter,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,25);</script>We have been careful,
that they that will read may have delight, and that they that are desirous
to commit to memory might have ease, and that all into whose hands it
comes might have profit.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,26);</script>Therefore to us, that
have taken upon us this painful labour of abridging, it was not easy, but
a matter of sweat and watching;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,27);</script>Even as it is no ease
unto him that prepareth a banquet, and seeketh the benefit of others: yet
for the pleasuring of many we will undertake gladly this great pains;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,28);</script>Leaving to the author
the exact handling of every particular, and labouring to follow the rules
of an abridgement.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,29);</script>For as the master
builder of a new house must care for the whole building; but he that
undertaketh to set it out, and paint it, must seek out fit things for the
adorning thereof: even so I think it is with us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,30);</script>To stand upon every
point, and go over things at large, and to be curious in particulars,
belongeth to the first author of the story:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,31);</script>But to use brevity,
and avoid much labouring of the work, is to be granted to him that will
make an abridgment.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,32);</script>Here then will we
begin the story: only adding thus much to that which hath been said, that
it is a foolish thing to make a long prologue, and to be short in the
story itself.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>Now when the holy city
was inhabited with all peace, and the laws were kept very well, because of
the godliness of Onias the high priest, and his hatred of wickedness,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>It came to pass that
even the kings themselves did honour the place, and magnify the temple
with their best gifts;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>Insomuch that Seleucus
of Asia of his own revenues bare all the costs belonging to the service of
the sacrifices.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>But one Simon of the
tribe of Benjamin, who was made governor of the temple, fell out with the
high priest about disorder in the city.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>And when he could not
overcome Onias, he gat him to Apollonius the son of Thraseas, who then was
governor of Celosyria and Phenice,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>And told him that the
treasury in Jerusalem was full of infinite sums of money, so that the
multitude of their riches, which did not pertain to the account of the
sacrifices, was innumerable, and that it was possible to bring all into
the king’s hand.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>Now when Apollonius
came to the king, and had shewed him of the money whereof he was told, the
king chose out Heliodorus his treasurer, and sent him with a commandment
to bring him the foresaid money.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>So forthwith Heliodorus
took his journey; under a colour of visiting the cities of Celosyria and
Phenice, but indeed to fulfil the king’s purpose.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>And when he was come to
Jerusalem, and had been courteously received of the high priest of the
city, he told him what intelligence was given of the money, and declared
wherefore he came, and asked if these things were so indeed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>Then the high priest
told him that there was such money laid up for the relief of widows and
fatherless children:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>And that some of it
belonged to Hircanus son of Tobias, a man of great dignity, and not as
that wicked Simon had misinformed: the sum whereof in all was four hundred
talents of silver, and two hundred of gold:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>And that it was
altogether impossible that such wrongs should be done unto them, that had
committed it to the holiness of the place, and to the majesty and
inviolable sanctity of the temple, honoured over all the world.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>But Heliodorus,
because of the king’s commandment given him, said, That in any wise it
must be brought into the king’s treasury.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>So at the day which he
appointed he entered in to order this matter: wherefore there was no small
agony throughout the whole city.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>But the priests,
prostrating themselves before the altar in their priests’ vestments,
called unto heaven upon him that made a law concerning things given to he
kept, that they should safely be preserved for such as had committed them
to be kept.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>Then whoso had looked
the high priest in the face, it would have wounded his heart: for his
countenance and the changing of his colour declared the inward agony of
his mind.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>For the man was so
compassed with fear and horror of the body, that it was manifest to them
that looked upon him, what sorrow he had now in his heart.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,18);</script>Others ran flocking
out of their houses to the general supplication, because the place was
like to come into contempt.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,19);</script>And the women, girt
with sackcloth under their breasts, abounded in the streets, and the
virgins that were kept in ran, some to the gates, and some to the walls,
and others looked out of the windows.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,20);</script>And all, holding their
hands toward heaven, made supplication.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,21);</script>Then it would have
pitied a man to see the falling down of the multitude of all sorts, and
the fear of the high priest being in such an agony.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,22);</script>They then called upon
the Almighty Lord to keep the things committed of trust safe and sure for
those that had committed them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,23);</script>Nevertheless
Heliodorus executed that which was decreed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,24);</script>Now as he was there
present himself with his guard about the treasury, the Lord of spirits,
and the Prince of all power, caused a great apparition, so that all that
presumed to come in with him were astonished at the power of God, and
fainted, and were sore afraid.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,25);</script>For there appeared
unto them an horse with a terrible rider upon him, and adorned with a very
fair covering, and he ran fiercely, and smote at Heliodorus with his
forefeet, and it seemed that he that sat upon the horse had complete
harness of gold.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,26);</script>Moreover two other
young men appeared before him, notable in strength, excellent in beauty,
and comely in apparel, who stood by him on either side; and scourged him
continually, and gave him many sore stripes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,27);</script>And Heliodorus fell
suddenly unto the ground, and was compassed with great darkness: but they
that were with him took him up, and put him into a litter.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,28);</script>Thus him, that lately
came with a great train and with all his guard into the said treasury,
they carried out, being unable to help himself with his weapons: and
manifestly they acknowledged the power of God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,29);</script>For he by the hand of
God was cast down, and lay speechless without all hope of life.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,30);</script>But they praised the
Lord, that had miraculously honoured his own place: for the temple; which
a little afore was full of fear and trouble, when the Almighty Lord
appeared, was filled with joy and gladness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,31);</script>Then straightways
certain of Heliodorus’ friends prayed Onias, that he would call upon the
most High to grant him his life, who lay ready to give up the ghost.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,32);</script>So the high priest,
suspecting lest the king should misconceive that some treachery had been
done to Heliodorus by the Jews, offered a sacrifice for the health of the
man.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,33);</script>Now as the high priest
was making an atonement, the same young men in the same clothing appeared
and stood beside Heliodorus, saying, Give Onias the high priest great
thanks, insomuch as for his sake the Lord hath granted thee life:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,34);</script>And seeing that thou
hast been scourged from heaven, declare unto all men the mighty power of
God. And when they had spoken these words, they appeared no more.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,35);</script>So Heliodorus, after
he had offered sacrifice unto the Lord, and made great vows unto him that
had saved his life, and saluted Onias, returned with his host to the king.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,36);</script>Then testified he to
all men the works of the great God, which he had seen with his eyes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,37);</script>And when the king
Heliodorus, who might be a fit man to be sent yet once again to Jerusalem,
he said,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,38);</script>If thou hast any enemy
or traitor, send him thither, and thou shalt receive him well scourged, if
he escape with his life: for in that place, no doubt; there is an especial
power of God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,39);</script>For he that dwelleth
in heaven hath his eye on that place, and defendeth it; and he beateth and
destroyeth them that come to hurt it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,40);</script>And the things
concerning Heliodorus, and the keeping of the treasury, fell out on this
sort.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>This Simon now, of whom
we spake afore, having been a betrayer of the money, and of his country,
slandered Onias, as if he ha terrified Heliodorus, and been the worker of
these evils.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>Thus was he bold to
call him a traitor, that had deserved well of the city, and tendered his
own nation, and was so zealous of the laws.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script>But when their hatred
went so far, that by one of Simon’s faction murders were committed,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,4);</script>Onias seeing the danger
of this contention, and that Apollonius, as being the governor of
Celosyria and Phenice, did rage, and increase Simon’s malice,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,5);</script>He went to the king,
not to be an accuser of his countrymen, but seeking the good of all, both
publick and private:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,6);</script>For he saw that it was
impossible that the state should continue quiet, and Simon leave his
folly, unless the king did look thereunto.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,7);</script>But after the death of
Seleucus, when Antiochus, called Epiphanes, took the kingdom, Jason the
brother of Onias laboured underhand to be high priest,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,8);</script>Promising unto the king
by intercession three hundred and threescore talents of silver, and of
another revenue eighty talents:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>Beside this, he
promised to assign an hundred and fifty more, if he might have licence to
set him up a place for exercise, and for the training up of youth in the
fashions of the heathen, and to write them of Jerusalem by the name of
Antiochians.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>Which when the king
had granted, and he had gotten into his hand the rule he forthwith brought
his own nation to Greekish fashion.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>And the royal
privileges granted of special favour to the Jews by the means of John the
father of Eupolemus, who went ambassador to Rome for amity and aid, he
took away; and putting down the governments which were according to the
law, he brought up new customs against the law:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,12);</script>For he built gladly a
place of exercise under the tower itself, and brought the chief young men
under his subjection, and made them wear a hat.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,13);</script>Now such was the
height of Greek fashions, and increase of heathenish manners, through the
exceeding profaneness of Jason, that ungodly wretch, and no high priest;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,14);</script>That the priests had
no courage to serve any more at the altar, but despising the temple, and
neglecting the sacrifices, hastened to be partakers of the unlawful
allowance in the place of exercise, after the game of Discus called them
forth;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,15);</script>Not setting by the
honours of their fathers, but liking the glory of the Grecians best of all.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,16);</script>By reason whereof sore
calamity came upon them: for they had them to be their enemies and
avengers, whose custom they followed so earnestly, and unto whom they
desired to be like in all things.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,17);</script>For it is not a light
thing to do wickedly against the laws of God: but the time following shall
declare these things.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,18);</script>Now when the game that
was used every faith year was kept at Tyrus, the king being present,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,19);</script>This ungracious Jason
sent special messengers from Jerusalem, who were Antiochians, to carry
three hundred drachms of silver to the sacrifice of Hercules, which even
the bearers thereof thought fit not to bestow upon the sacrifice, because
it was not convenient, but to be reserved for other charges.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,20);</script>This money then, in
regard of the sender, was appointed to Hercules’ sacrifice; but because
of the bearers thereof, it was employed to the making of gallies.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>Now when Apollonius
the son of Menestheus was sent into Egypt for the coronation of king
Ptolemeus Philometor, Antiochus, understanding him not to be well affected
to his affairs, provided for his own safety: whereupon he came to Joppa,
and from thence to Jerusalem:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,22);</script>Where he was
honourably received of Jason, and of the city, and was brought in with
torch alight, and with great shoutings: and so afterward went with his
host unto Phenice.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,23);</script>Three years afterward
Jason sent Menelaus, the aforesaid Simon’s brother, to bear the money
unto the king, and to put him in mind of certain necessary matters.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,24);</script>But he being brought
to the presence of the king, when he had magnified him for the glorious
appearance of his power, got the priesthood to himself, offering more than
Jason by three hundred talents of silver.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,25);</script>So he came with the
king’s mandate, bringing nothing worthy the high priesthood, but having
the fury of a cruel tyrant, and the rage of a savage beast.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,26);</script>Then Jason, who had
undermined his own brother, being undermined by another, was compelled to
flee into the country of the Ammonites.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,27);</script>So Menelaus got the
principality: but as for the money that he had promised unto the king, he
took no good order for it, albeit Sostratis the ruler of the castle
required it:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,28);</script>For unto him
appertained the gathering of the customs. Wherefore they were both called
before the king.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,29);</script>Now Menelaus left his
brother Lysimachus in his stead in the priesthood; and Sostratus left
Crates, who was governor of the Cyprians.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,30);</script>While those things
were in doing, they of Tarsus and Mallos made insurrection, because they
were given to the king’s concubine, called Antiochus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,31);</script>Then came the king in
all haste to appease matters, leaving Andronicus, a man in authority, for
his deputy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,32);</script>Now Menelaus,
supposing that he had gotten a convenient time, stole certain vessels of
gold out of the temple, and gave some of them to Andronicus, and some he
sold into Tyrus and the cities round about.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,33);</script>Which when Onias knew
of a surety, he reproved him, and withdrew himself into a sanctuary at
Daphne, that lieth by Antiochia.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,34);</script>Wherefore Menelaus,
taking Andronicus apart, prayed, him to get Onias into his hands; who
being persuaded thereunto, and coming to Onias in deceit, gave him his
right hand with oaths; and though he were suspected by him, yet persuaded
he him to come forth of the sanctuary: whom forthwith he shut up without
regard of justice.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,35);</script>For the which cause
not only the Jews, but many also of other nations, took great indignation,
and were much grieved for the unjust murder of the man.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,36);</script>And when the king was
come again from the places about Cilicia, the Jews that were in the city,
and certain of the Greeks that abhorred the fact also, complained because
Onias was slain without cause.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,37);</script>Therefore Antiochus
was heartily sorry, and moved to pity, and wept, because of the sober and
modest behaviour of him that was dead.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,38);</script>And being kindled with
anger, forthwith he took away Andronicus his purple, and rent off his
clothes, and leading him through the whole city unto that very place,
where he had committed impiety against Onias, there slew he the cursed
murderer. Thus the Lord rewarded him his punishment, as he had deserved.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,39);</script>Now when many
sacrileges had been committed in the city by Lysimachus with the consent
of Menelaus, and the fruit thereof was spread abroad, the multitude
gathered themselves together against Lysimachus, many vessels of gold
being already carried away.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,40);</script>Whereupon the common
people rising, and being filled with rage, Lysimachus armed about three
thousand men, and began first to offer violence; one Auranus being the
leader, a man far gone in years, and no less in folly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,41);</script>They then seeing the
attempt of Lysimachus, some of them caught stones, some clubs, others
taking handfuls of dust, that was next at hand, cast them all together
upon Lysimachus, and those that set upon them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,42);</script>Thus many of them they
wounded, and some they struck to the ground, and all of them they forced
to flee: but as for the churchrobber himself, him they killed beside the
treasury.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,43);</script>Of these matters
therefore there was an accusation laid against Menelaus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,44);</script>Now when the king came
to Tyrus, three men that were sent from the senate pleaded the cause
before him:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,45);</script>But Menelaus, being
now convicted, promised Ptolemee the son of Dorymenes to give him much
money, if he would pacify the king toward him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,46);</script>Whereupon Ptolemee
taking the king aside into a certain gallery, as it were to take the air,
brought him to be of another mind:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,47);</script>Insomuch that he
discharged Menelaus from the accusations, who notwithstanding was cause of
all the mischief: and those poor men, who, if they had told their cause,
yea, before the Scythians, should have been judged innocent, them he
condemned to death.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,48);</script>Thus they that
followed the matter for the city, and for the people, and for the holy
vessels, did soon suffer unjust punishment.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,49);</script>Wherefore even they of
Tyrus, moved with hatred of that wicked deed, caused them to be honourably
buried.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,50);</script>And so through the
covetousness of them that were of power Menelaus remained still in
authority, increasing in malice, and being a great traitor to the citizens.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>About the same time
Antiochus prepared his second voyage into Egypt:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>And then it happened,
that through all the city, for the space almost of forty days, there were
seen horsemen running in the air, in cloth of gold, and armed with lances,
like a band of soldiers,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>And troops of horsemen
in array, encountering and running one against another, with shaking of
shields, and multitude of pikes, and drawing of swords, and casting of
darts, and glittering of golden ornaments, and harness of all sorts.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>Wherefore every man
prayed that that apparition might turn to good.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>Now when there was gone
forth a false rumour, as though Antiochus had been dead, Jason took at the
least a thousand men, and suddenly made an assault upon the city; and they
that were upon the walls being put back, and the city at length taken,
Menelaus fled into the castle:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>But Jason slew his own
citizens without mercy, not considering that to get the day of them of his
own nation would be a most unhappy day for him; but thinking they had been
his enemies, and not his countrymen, whom he conquered.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>Howbeit for all this he
obtained not the principality, but at the last received shame for the
reward of his treason, and fled again into the country of the Ammonites.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>In the end therefore he
had an unhappy return, being accused before Aretas the king of the
Arabians, fleeing from city to city, pursued of all men, hated as a
forsaker of the laws, and being had in abomination as an open enemy of his
country and countrymen, he was cast out into Egypt.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>Thus he that had driven
many out of their country perished in a strange land, retiring to the
Lacedemonians, and thinking there to find succour by reason of his kindred:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>And he that had cast
out many unburied had none to mourn for him, nor any solemn funerals at
all, nor sepulchre with his fathers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>Now when this that was
done came to the king’s car, he thought that Judea had revolted:
whereupon removing out of Egypt in a furious mind, he took the city by
force of arms,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>And commanded his men
of war not to spare such as they met, and to slay such as went up upon the
houses.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,13);</script>Thus there was killing
of young and old, making away of men, women, and children, slaying of
virgins and infants.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,14);</script>And there were
destroyed within the space of three whole days fourscore thousand, whereof
forty thousand were slain in the conflict; and no fewer sold than slain.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,15);</script>Yet was he not content
with this, but presumed to go into the most holy temple of all the world;
Menelaus, that traitor to the laws, and to his own country, being his
guide:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,16);</script>And taking the holy
vessels with polluted hands, and with profane hands pulling down the
things that were dedicated by other kings to the augmentation and glory
and honour of the place, he gave them away.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,17);</script>And so haughty was
Antiochus in mind, that he considered not that the Lord was angry for a
while for the sins of them that dwelt in the city, and therefore his eye
was not upon the place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,18);</script>For had they not been
formerly wrapped in many sins, this man, as soon as he had come, had
forthwith been scourged, and put back from his presumption, as Heliodorus
was, whom Seleucus the king sent to view the treasury.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,19);</script>Nevertheless God did
not choose the people for the place’s sake, but the place far the
people’s sake.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,20);</script>And therefore the
place itself, that was partaker with them of the adversity that happened
to the nation, did afterward communicate in the benefits sent from the
Lord: and as it was forsaken in the wrath of the Almighty, so again, the
great Lord being reconciled, it was set up with all glory.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,21);</script>So when Antiochus had
carried out of the temple a thousand and eight hundred talents, he
departed in all haste unto Antiochia, weening in his pride to make the
land navigable, and the sea passable by foot: such was the haughtiness of
his mind.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,22);</script>And he left governors
to vex the nation: at Jerusalem, Philip, for his country a Phrygian, and
for manners more barbarous than he that set him there;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,23);</script>And at Garizim,
Andronicus; and besides, Menelaus, who worse than all the rest bare an
heavy hand over the citizens, having a malicious mind against his
countrymen the Jews.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,24);</script>He sent also that
detestable ringleader Apollonius with an army of two and twenty thousand,
commanding him to slay all those that were in their best age, and to sell
the women and the younger sort:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,25);</script>Who coming to
Jerusalem, and pretending peace, did forbear till the holy day of the
sabbath, when taking the Jews keeping holy day, he commanded his men to
arm themselves.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,26);</script>And so he slew all
them that were gone to the celebrating of the sabbath, and running through
the city with weapons slew great multitudes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,27);</script>But Judas Maccabeus
with nine others, or thereabout, withdrew himself into the wilderness, and
lived in the mountains after the manner of beasts, with his company, who
fed on herbs continually, lest they should be partakers of the pollution.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>Not long after this the
king sent an old man of Athens to compel the Jews to depart from the laws
of their fathers, and not to live after the laws of God:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>And to pollute also the
temple in Jerusalem, and to call it the temple of Jupiter Olympius; and
that in Garizim, of Jupiter the Defender of strangers, as they did desire
that dwelt in the place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>The coming in of this
mischief was sore and grievous to the people:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,4);</script>For the temple was
filled with riot and revelling by the Gentiles, who dallied with harlots,
and had to do with women within the circuit of the holy places, and
besides that brought in things that were not lawful.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>The altar also was
filled with profane things, which the law forbiddeth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>Neither was it lawful
for a man to keep sabbath days or ancient fasts, or to profess himself at
all to be a Jew.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>And in the day of the
king’s birth every month they were brought by bitter constraint to eat
of the sacrifices; and when the fast of Bacchus was kept, the Jews were
compelled to go in procession to Bacchus, carrying ivy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>Moreover there went out
a decree to the neighbour cities of the heathen, by the suggestion of
Ptolemee, against the Jews, that they should observe the same fashions,
and be partakers of their sacrifices:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>And whoso would not
conform themselves to the manners of the Gentiles should be put to death.
Then might a man have seen the present misery.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>For there were two
women brought, who had circumcised their children; whom when they had
openly led round about the city, the babes handing at their breasts, they
cast them down headlong from the wall.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,11);</script>And others, that had
run together into caves near by, to keep the sabbath day secretly, being
discovered by Philip, were all burnt together, because they made a
conscience to help themselves for the honour of the most sacred day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>Now I beseech those
that read this book, that they be not discouraged for these calamities,
but that they judge those punishments not to be for destruction, but for a
chastening of our nation.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>For it is a token of
his great goodness, when wicked doers are not suffered any long time, but
forthwith punished.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>For not as with other
nations, whom the Lord patiently forbeareth to punish, till they be come
to the fulness of their sins, so dealeth he with us,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>Lest that, being come
to the height of sin, afterwards he should take vengeance of us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,16);</script>And therefore he never
withdraweth his mercy from us: and though he punish with adversity, yet
doth he never forsake his people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,17);</script>But let this that we
at spoken be for a warning unto us. And now will we come to the declaring
of the matter in a few words.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,18);</script>Eleazar, one of the
principal scribes, an aged man, and of a well favoured countenance, was
constrained to open his mouth, and to eat swine’s flesh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,19);</script>But he, choosing
rather to die gloriously, than to live stained with such an abomination,
spit it forth, and came of his own accord to the torment,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,20);</script>As it behoved them to
come, that are resolute to stand out against such things, as are not
lawful for love of life to be tasted.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,21);</script>But they that had the
charge of that wicked feast, for the old acquaintance they had with the
man, taking him aside, besought him to bring flesh of his own provision,
such as was lawful for him to use, and make as if he did eat of the flesh
taken from the sacrifice commanded by the king;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,22);</script>That in so doing he
might be delivered from death, and for the old friendship with them find
favour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,23);</script>But he began to
consider discreetly, and as became his age, and the excellency of his
ancient years, and the honour of his gray head, whereon was come, and his
most honest education from a child, or rather the holy law made and given
by God: therefore he answered accordingly, and willed them straightways to
send him to the grave.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,24);</script>For it becometh not
our age, said he, in any wise to dissemble, whereby many young persons
might think that Eleazar, being fourscore years old and ten, were now gone
to a strange religion;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,25);</script>And so they through
mine hypocrisy, and desire to live a little time and a moment longer,
should be deceived by me, and I get a stain to mine old age, and make it
abominable.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,26);</script>For though for the
present time I should be delivered from the punishment of men: yet should
I not escape the hand of the Almighty, neither alive, nor dead.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,27);</script>Wherefore now,
manfully changing this life, I will shew myself such an one as mine age
requireth,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,28);</script>And leave a notable
example to such as be young to die willingly and courageously for the
honourable and holy laws. And when he had said these words, immediately he
went to the torment:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,29);</script>They that led him
changing the good will they bare him a little before into hatred, because
the foresaid speeches proceeded, as they thought, from a desperate mind.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,30);</script>But when he was ready
to die with stripes, he groaned, and said, It is manifest unto the Lord,
that hath the holy knowledge, that whereas I might have been delivered
from death, I now endure sore pains in body by being beaten: but in soul
am well content to suffer these things, because I fear him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,31);</script>And thus this man
died, leaving his death for an example of a noble courage, and a memorial
of virtue, not only unto young men, but unto all his nation.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,1);</script>It came to pass also,
that seven brethren with their mother were taken, and compelled by the
king against the law to taste swine’s flesh, and were tormented with
scourges and whips.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,2);</script>But one of them that
spake first said thus, What wouldest thou ask or learn of us? we are ready
to die, rather than to transgress the laws of our fathers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,3);</script>Then the king, being in
a rage, commanded pans and caldrons to be made hot:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,4);</script>Which forthwith being
heated, he commanded to cut out the tongue of him that spake first, and to
cut off the utmost parts of his body, the rest of his brethren and his
mother looking on.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,5);</script>Now when he was thus
maimed in all his members, he commanded him being yet alive to be brought
to the fire, and to be fried in the pan: and as the vapour of the pan was
for a good space dispersed, they exhorted one another with the mother to
die manfully, saying thus,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,6);</script>The Lord God looketh
upon us, and in truth hath comfort in us, as Moses in his song, which
witnessed to their faces, declared, saying, And he shall be comforted in
his servants.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,7);</script>So when the first was
dead after this number, they brought the second to make him a mocking
stock: and when they had pulled off the skin of his head with the hair,
they asked him, Wilt thou eat, before thou be punished throughout every
member of thy body?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,8);</script>But he answered in his
own language, and said, No. Wherefore he also received the next torment in
order, as the former did.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,9);</script>And when he was at the
last gasp, he said, Thou like a fury takest us out of this present life,
but the King of the world shall raise us up, who have died for his laws,
unto everlasting life.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,10);</script>After him was the
third made a mocking stock: and when he was required, he put out his
tongue, and that right soon, holding forth his hands manfully.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,11);</script>And said courageously,
These I had from heaven; and for his laws I despise them; and from him I
hope to receive them again.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,12);</script>Insomuch that the
king, and they that were with him, marvelled at the young man’s courage,
for that he nothing regarded the pains.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,13);</script>Now when this man was
dead also, they tormented and mangled the fourth in like manner.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,14);</script>So when he was ready
to die he said thus, It is good, being put to death by men, to look for
hope from God to be raised up again by him: as for thee, thou shalt have
no resurrection to life.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,15);</script>Afterward they brought
the fifth also, and mangled him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,16);</script>Then looked he unto
the king, and said, Thou hast power over men, thou art corruptible, thou
doest what thou wilt; yet think not that our nation is forsaken of God;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,17);</script>But abide a while, and
behold his great power, how he will torment thee and thy seed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,18);</script>After him also they
brought the sixth, who being ready to die said, Be not deceived without
cause: for we suffer these things for ourselves, having sinned against our
God: therefore marvellous things are done unto us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,19);</script>But think not thou,
that takest in hand to strive against God, that thou shalt escape
unpunished.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,20);</script>But the mother was
marvellous above all, and worthy of honourable memory: for when she saw
her seven sons slain within the space of one day, she bare it with a good
courage, because of the hope that she had in the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,21);</script>Yea, she exhorted
every one of them in her own language, filled with courageous spirits; and
stirring up her womanish thoughts with a manly stomach, she said unto them,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,22);</script>I cannot tell how ye
came into my womb: for I neither gave you breath nor life, neither was it
I that formed the members of every one of you;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,23);</script>But doubtless the
Creator of the world, who formed the generation of man, and found out the
beginning of all things, will also of his own mercy give you breath and
life again, as ye now regard not your own selves for his laws’ sake.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,24);</script>Now Antiochus,
thinking himself despised, and suspecting it to be a reproachful speech,
whilst the youngest was yet alive, did not only exhort him by words, but
also assured him with oaths, that he would make him both a rich and a
happy man, if he would turn from the laws of his fathers; and that also he
would take him for his friend, and trust him with affairs.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,25);</script>But when the young man
would in no case hearken unto him, the king called his mother, and
exhorted her that she would counsel the young man to save his life.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,26);</script>And when he had
exhorted her with many words, she promised him that she would counsel her
son.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,27);</script>But she bowing herself
toward him, laughing the cruel tyrant to scorn, spake in her country
language on this manner; O my son, have pity upon me that bare thee nine
months in my womb, and gave thee such three years, and nourished thee, and
brought thee up unto this age, and endured the troubles of education.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,28);</script>I beseech thee, my
son, look upon the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, and
consider that God made them of things that were not; and so was mankind
made likewise.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,29);</script>Fear not this
tormentor, but, being worthy of thy brethren, take thy death that I may
receive thee again in mercy with thy brethren.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,30);</script>Whiles she was yet
speaking these words, the young man said, Whom wait ye for? I will not
obey the king’s commandment: but I will obey the commandment of the law
that was given unto our fathers by Moses.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,31);</script>And thou, that hast
been the author of all mischief against the Hebrews, shalt not escape the
hands of God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,32);</script>For we suffer because
of our sins.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,33);</script>And though the living
Lord be angry with us a little while for our chastening and correction,
yet shall he be at one again with his servants.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,34);</script>But thou, O godless
man, and of all other most wicked, be not lifted up without a cause, nor
puffed up with uncertain hopes, lifting up thy hand against the servants
of God:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,35);</script>For thou hast not yet
escaped the judgment of Almighty God, who seeth all things.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,36);</script>For our brethren, who
now have suffered a short pain, are dead under God’s covenant of
everlasting life: but thou, through the judgment of God, shalt receive
just punishment for thy pride.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,37);</script>But I, as my brethren,
offer up my body and life for the laws of our fathers, beseeching God that
he would speedily be merciful unto our nation; and that thou by torments
and plagues mayest confess, that he alone is God;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,38);</script>And that in me and my
brethren the wrath of the Almighty, which is justly brought upon our
nation, may cease.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,39);</script>Than the king’ being
in a rage, handed him worse than all the rest, and took it grievously that
he was mocked.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,40);</script>So this man died
undefiled, and put his whole trust in the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,41);</script>Last of all after the
sons the mother died.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,42);</script>Let this be enough now
to have spoken concerning the idolatrous feasts, and the extreme tortures.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,1);</script>Then Judas Maccabeus,
and they that were with him, went privily into the towns, and called their
kinsfolks together, and took unto them all such as continued in the
Jews’ religion, and assembled about six thousand men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,2);</script>And they called upon
the Lord, that he would look upon the people that was trodden down of all;
and also pity the temple profaned of ungodly men;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,3);</script>And that he would have
compassion upon the city, sore defaced, and ready to be made even with the
ground; and hear the blood that cried unto him,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,4);</script>And remember the wicked
slaughter of harmless infants, and the blasphemies committed against his
name; and that he would shew his hatred against the wicked.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script>Now when Maccabeus had
his company about him, he could not be withstood by the heathen: for the
wrath of the Lord was turned into mercy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,6);</script>Therefore he came at
unawares, and burnt up towns and cities, and got into his hands the most
commodious places, and overcame and put to flight no small number of his
enemies.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,7);</script>But specially took he
advantage of the night for such privy attempts, insomuch that the fruit of
his holiness was spread every where.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,8);</script>So when Philip saw that
this man increased by little and little, and that things prospered with
him still more and more, he wrote unto Ptolemeus, the governor of
Celosyria and Phenice, to yield more aid to the king’s affairs.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,9);</script>Then forthwith choosing
Nicanor the son of Patroclus, one of his special friends, he sent him with
no fewer than twenty thousand of all nations under him, to root out the
whole generation of the Jews; and with him he joined also Gorgias a
captain, who in matters of war had great experience.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>So Nicanor undertook
to make so much money of the captive Jews, as should defray the tribute of
two thousand talents, which the king was to pay to the Romans.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,11);</script>Wherefore immediately
he sent to the cities upon the sea coast, proclaiming a sale of the
captive Jews, and promising that they should have fourscore and ten bodies
for one talent, not expecting the vengeance that was to follow upon him
from the Almighty God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,12);</script>Now when word was
brought unto Judas of Nicanor’s coming, and he had imparted unto those
that were with him that the army was at hand,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,13);</script>They that were
fearful, and distrusted the justice of God, fled, and conveyed themselves
away.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,14);</script>Others sold all that
they had left, and withal besought the Lord to deliver them, sold by the
wicked Nicanor before they met together:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,15);</script>And if not for their
own sakes, yet for the covenants he had made with their fathers, and for
his holy and glorious name’s sake, by which they were called.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,16);</script>So Maccabeus called
his men together unto the number of six thousand, and exhorted them not to
be stricken with terror of the enemy, nor to fear the great multitude of
the heathen, who came wrongly against them; but to fight manfully,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,17);</script>And to set before
their eyes the injury that they had unjustly done to the holy place, and
the cruel handling of the city, whereof they made a mockery, and also the
taking away of the government of their forefathers:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,18);</script>For they, said he,
trust in their weapons and boldness; but our confidence is in the Almighty
who at a beck can cast down both them that come against us, and also all
the world.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,19);</script>Moreover, he recounted
unto them what helps their forefathers had found, and how they were
delivered, when under Sennacherib an hundred fourscore and five thousand
perished.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,20);</script>And he told them of
the battle that they had in Babylon with the Galatians, how they came but
eight thousand in all to the business, with four thousand Macedonians, and
that the Macedonians being perplexed, the eight thousand destroyed an
hundred and twenty thousand because of the help that they had from heaven,
and so received a great booty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,21);</script>Thus when he had made
them bold with these words, and ready to die for the law and the country,
he divided his army into four parts;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,22);</script>And joined with
himself his own brethren, leaders of each band, to wit Simon, and Joseph,
and Jonathan, giving each one fifteen hundred men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,23);</script>Also he appointed
Eleazar to read the holy book: and when he had given them this watchword,
The help of God; himself leading the first band,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,24);</script>And by the help of the
Almighty they slew above nine thousand of their enemies, and wounded and
maimed the most part of Nicanor’s host, and so put all to flight;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,25);</script>And took their money
that came to buy them, and pursued them far: but lacking time they
returned:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,26);</script>For it was the day
before the sabbath, and therefore they would no longer pursue them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,27);</script>So when they had
gathered their armour together, and spoiled their enemies, they occupied
themselves about the sabbath, yielding exceeding praise and thanks to the
Lord, who had preserved them unto that day, which was the beginning of
mercy distilling upon them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,28);</script>And after the sabbath,
when they had given part of the spoils to the maimed, and the widows, and
orphans, the residue they divided among themselves and their servants.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,29);</script>When this was done,
and they had made a common supplication, they besought the merciful Lord
to be reconciled with his servants for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,30);</script>Moreover of those that
were with Timotheus and Bacchides, who fought against them, they slew
above twenty thousand, and very easily got high and strong holds, and
divided among themselves many spoils more, and made the maimed, orphans,
widows, yea, and the aged also, equal in spoils with themselves.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,31);</script>And when they had
gathered their armour together, they laid them up all carefully in
convenient places, and the remnant of the spoils they brought to Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,32);</script>They slew also
Philarches, that wicked person, who was with Timotheus, and had annoyed
the Jews many ways.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,33);</script>Furthermore at such
time as they kept the feast for the victory in their country they burnt
Callisthenes, that had set fire upon the holy gates, who had fled into a
little house; and so he received a reward meet for his wickedness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,34);</script>As for that most
ungracious Nicanor, who had brought a thousand merchants to buy the Jews,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,35);</script>He was through the
help of the Lord brought down by them, of whom he made least account; and
putting off his glorious apparel, and discharging his company, he came
like a fugitive servant through the midland unto Antioch having very great
dishonour, for that his host was destroyed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,36);</script>Thus he, that took
upon him to make good to the Romans their tribute by means of captives in
Jerusalem, told abroad, that the Jews had God to fight for them, and
therefore they could not be hurt, because they followed the laws that he
gave them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>About that time came
Antiochus with dishonour out of the country of Persia
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>For he had entered the
city called Persepolis, and went about to rob the temple, and to hold the
city; whereupon the multitude running to defend themselves with their
weapons put them to flight; and so it happened, that Antiochus being put
to flight of the inhabitants returned with shame.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>Now when he came to
Ecbatane, news was brought him what had happened unto Nicanor and
Timotheus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,4);</script>Then swelling with
anger. he thought to avenge upon the Jews the disgrace done unto him by
those that made him flee. Therefore commanded he his chariotman to drive
without ceasing, and to dispatch the journey, the judgment of God now
following him. For he had spoken proudly in this sort, That he would come
to Jerusalem and make it a common burying place of the Jews.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,5);</script>But the Lord Almighty,
the God of Isreal, smote him with an incurable and invisible plague: or as
soon as he had spoken these words, a pain of the bowels that was
remediless came upon him, and sore torments of the inner parts;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,6);</script>And that most justly:
for he had tormented other men’s bowels with many and strange torments.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,7);</script>Howbeit he nothing at
all ceased from his bragging, but still was filled with pride, breathing
out fire in his rage against the Jews, and commanding to haste the
journey: but it came to pass that he fell down from his chariot, carried
violently; so that having a sore fall, all the members of his body were
much pained.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,8);</script>And thus he that a
little afore thought he might command the waves of the sea, (so proud was
he beyond the condition of man) and weigh the high mountains in a balance,
was now cast on the ground, and carried in an horselitter, shewing forth
unto all the manifest power of God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,9);</script>So that the worms rose
up out of the body of this wicked man, and whiles he lived in sorrow and
pain, his flesh fell away, and the filthiness of his smell was noisome to
all his army.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>And the man, that
thought a little afore he could reach to the stars of heaven, no man could
endure to carry for his intolerable stink.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>Here therefore, being
plagued, he began to leave off his great pride, and to come to the
knowledge of himself by the scourge of God, his pain increasing every
moment.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,12);</script>And when he himself
could not abide his own smell, he said these words, It is meet to be
subject unto God, and that a man that is mortal should not proudly think
of himself if he were God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,13);</script>This wicked person
vowed also unto the Lord, who now no more would have mercy upon him,
saying thus,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,14);</script>That the holy city (to
the which he was going in haste to lay it even with the ground, and to
make it a common buryingplace,) he would set at liberty:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,15);</script>And as touching the
Jews, whom he had judged not worthy so much as to be buried, but to be
cast out with their children to be devoured of the fowls and wild beasts,
he would make them all equals to the citizens of Athens:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,16);</script>And the holy temple,
which before he had spoiled, he would garnish with goodly gifts, and
restore all the holy vessels with many more, and out of his own revenue
defray the charges belonging to the sacrifices:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,17);</script>Yea, and that also he
would become a Jew himself, and go through all the world that was
inhabited, and declare the power of God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,18);</script>But for all this his
pains would not cease: for the just judgment of God was come upon him:
therefore despairing of his health, he wrote unto the Jews the letter
underwritten, containing the form of a supplication, after this manner:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,19);</script>Antiochus, king and
governor, to the good Jews his citizens wisheth much joy, health, and
prosperity:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,20);</script>If ye and your
children fare well, and your affairs be to your contentment, I give very
great thanks to God, having my hope in heaven.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,21);</script>As for me, I was weak,
or else I would have remembered kindly your honour and good will returning
out of Persia, and being taken with a grievous disease, I thought it
necessary to care for the common safety of all:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,22);</script>Not distrusting mine
health, but having great hope to escape this sickness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,23);</script>But considering that
even my father, at what time he led an army into the high countries.
appointed a successor,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,24);</script>To the end that, if
any thing fell out contrary to expectation, or if any tidings were brought
that were grievous, they of the land, knowing to whom the state was left,
might not be troubled:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,25);</script>Again, considering how
that the princes that are borderers and neighbours unto my kingdom wait
for opportunities, and expect what shall be the event. I have appointed my
son Antiochus king, whom I often committed and commended unto many of you,
when I went up into the high provinces; to whom I have written as
followeth:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,26);</script>Therefore I pray and
request you to remember the benefits that I have done unto you generally,
and in special, and that every man will be still faithful to me and my son.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,27);</script>For I am persuaded
that he understanding my mind will favourably and graciously yield to your
desires.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,28);</script>Thus the murderer and
blasphemer having suffered most grievously, as he entreated other men, so
died he a miserable death in a strange country in the mountains.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,29);</script>And Philip, that was
brought up with him, carried away his body, who also fearing the son of
Antiochus went into Egypt to Ptolemeus Philometor.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script>Now Maccabeus and his
company, the Lord guiding them, recovered the temple and the city:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,2);</script>But the altars which
the heathen had built in the open street, and also the chapels, they
pulled down.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,3);</script>And having cleansed
the temple they made another altar, and striking stones they took fire out
of them, and offered a sacrifice after two years, and set forth incense,
and lights, and shewbread.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,4);</script>When that was done,
they fell flat down, and besought the Lord that they might come no more
into such troubles; but if they sinned any more against him, that he
himself would chasten them with mercy, and that they might not be
delivered unto the blasphemous and barbarous nations.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,5);</script>Now upon the same day
that the strangers profaned the temple, on the very same day it was
cleansed again, even the five and twentieth day of the same month, which
is Casleu.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,6);</script>And they kept the
eight days with gladness, as in the feast of the tabernacles, remembering
that not long afore they had held the feast of the tabernacles, when as
they wandered in the mountains and dens like beasts.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,7);</script>Therefore they bare
branches, and fair boughs, and palms also, and sang psalms unto him that
had given them good success in cleansing his place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,8);</script>They ordained also by
a common statute and decree, That every year those days should be kept of
the whole nation of the Jews.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,9);</script>And this was the end
of Antiochus, called Epiphanes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,10);</script>Now will we declare
the acts of Antiochus Eupator, who was the son of this wicked man,
gathering briefly the calamities of the wars.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,11);</script>So when he was come
to the crown, he set one Lysias over the affairs of his realm, and
appointed him his chief governor of Celosyria and Phenice.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,12);</script>For Ptolemeus, that
was called Macron, choosing rather to do justice unto the Jews for the
wrong that had been done unto them, endeavoured to continue peace with
them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,13);</script>Whereupon being
accused of the king’s friends before Eupator, and called traitor at
every word because he had left Cyprus, that Philometor had committed unto
him, and departed to Antiochus Epiphanes, and seeing that he was in no
honourable place, he was so discouraged, that he poisoned himself and died.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,14);</script>But when Gorgias was
governor of the holds, he hired soldiers, and nourished war continually
with the Jews:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,15);</script>And therewithall the
Idumeans, having gotten into their hands the most commodious holds, kept
the Jews occupied, and receiving those that were banished from Jerusalem,
they went about to nourish war.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,16);</script>Then they that were
with Maccabeus made supplication, and besought God that he would be their
helper; and so they ran with violence upon the strong holds of the
Idumeans,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,17);</script>And assaulting them
strongly, they won the holds, and kept off all that fought upon the wall,
and slew all that fell into their hands, and killed no fewer than twenty
thousand.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,18);</script>And because certain,
who were no less than nine thousand, were fled together into two very
strong castles, having all manner of things convenient to sustain the
siege,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,19);</script>Maccabeus left Simon
and Joseph, and Zaccheus also, and them that were with him, who were
enough to besiege them, and departed himself unto those places which more
needed his help.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,20);</script>Now they that were
with Simon, being led with covetousness, were persuaded for money through
certain of those that were in the castle, and took seventy thousand
drachms, and let some of them escape.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,21);</script>But when it was told
Maccabeus what was done, he called the governors of the people together,
and accused those men, that they had sold their brethren for money, and
set their enemies free to fight against them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,22);</script>So he slew those that
were found traitors, and immediately took the two castles.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,23);</script>And having good
success with his weapons in all things he took in hand, he slew in the two
holds more than twenty thousand.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,24);</script>Now Timotheus, whom
the Jews had overcome before, when he had gathered a great multitude of
foreign forces, and horses out of Asia not a few, came as though he would
take Jewry by force of arms.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,25);</script>But when he drew
near, they that were with Maccabeus turned themselves to pray unto God,
and sprinkled earth upon their heads, and girded their loins with
sackcloth,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,26);</script>And fell down at the
foot of the altar, and besought him to be merciful to them, and to be an
enemy to their enemies, and an adversary to their adversaries, as the law
declareth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,27);</script>So after the prayer
they took their weapons, and went on further from the city: and when they
drew near to their enemies, they kept by themselves.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,28);</script>Now the sun being
newly risen, they joined both together; the one part having together with
their virtue their refuge also unto the Lord for a pledge of their success
and victory: the other side making their rage leader of their battle
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,29);</script>But when the battle
waxed strong, there appeared unto the enemies from heaven five comely men
upon horses, with bridles of gold, and two of them led the Jews,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,30);</script>And took Maccabeus
betwixt them, and covered him on every side weapons, and kept him safe,
but shot arrows and lightnings against the enemies: so that being
confounded with blindness, and full of trouble, they were killed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,31);</script>And there were slain
of footmen twenty thousand and five hundred, and six hundred horsemen.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,32);</script>As for Timotheus
himself, he fled into a very strong hold, called Gawra, where Chereas was
governor.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,33);</script>But they that were
with Maccabeus laid siege against the fortress courageously four days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,34);</script>And they that were
within, trusting to the strength of the place, blasphemed exceedingly, and
uttered wicked words.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,35);</script>Nevertheless upon the
fifth day early twenty young men of Maccabeus’ company, inflamed with
anger because of the blasphemies, assaulted the wall manly, and with a
fierce courage killed all that they met withal.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,36);</script>Others likewise
ascending after them, whiles they were busied with them that were within,
burnt the towers, and kindling fires burnt the blasphemers alive; and
others broke open the gates, and, having received in the rest of the army,
took the city,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,37);</script>And killed Timotheus,
that was hid in a certain pit, and Chereas his brother, with Apollophanes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,38);</script>When this was done,
they praised the Lord with psalms and thanksgiving, who had done so great
things for Israel, and given them the victory.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>Not long after the,
Lysias the king’s protector and cousin, who also managed the affairs,
took sore displeasure for the things that were done.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>And when he had
gathered about fourscore thousand with all the horsemen, he came against
the Jews, thinking to make the city an habitation of the Gentiles,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,3);</script>And to make a gain of
the temple, as of the other chapels of the heathen, and to set the high
priesthood to sale every year:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,4);</script>Not at all considering
the power of God but puffed up with his ten thousands of footmen, and his
thousands of horsemen, and his fourscore elephants.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,5);</script>So he came to Judea,
and drew near to Bethsura, which was a strong town, but distant from
Jerusalem about five furlongs, and he laid sore siege unto it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,6);</script>Now when they that
were with Maccabeus heard that he besieged the holds, they and all the
people with lamentation and tears besought the Lord that he would send a
good angel to deliver Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,7);</script>Then Maccabeus himself
first of all took weapons, exhorting the other that they would jeopard
themselves together with him to help their brethren: so they went forth
together with a willing mind.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,8);</script>And as they were at
Jerusalem, there appeared before them on horseback one in white clothing,
shaking his armour of gold.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,9);</script>Then they praised the
merciful God all together, and took heart, insomuch that they were ready
not only to fight with men, but with most cruel beasts, and to pierce
through walls of iron.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,10);</script>Thus they marched
forward in their armour, having an helper from heaven: for the Lord was
merciful unto them
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,11);</script>And giving a charge
upon their enemies like lions, they slew eleven thousand footmen, and
sixteen hundred horsemen, and put all the other to flight.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,12);</script>Many of them also
being wounded escaped naked; and Lysias himself fled away shamefully, and
so escaped.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,13);</script>Who, as he was a man
of understanding, casting with himself what loss he had had, and
considering that the Hebrews could not be overcome, because the Almighty
God helped them, he sent unto them,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,14);</script>And persuaded them to
agree to all reasonable conditions, and promised that he would persuade
the king that he must needs be a friend unto them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,15);</script>Then Maccabeus
consented to all that Lysias desired, being careful of the common good;
and whatsoever Maccabeus wrote unto Lysias concerning the Jews, the king
granted it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,16);</script>For there were
letters written unto the Jews from Lysias to this effect: Lysias unto the
people of the Jews sendeth greeting:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,17);</script>John and Absolom, who
were sent from you, delivered me the petition subscribed, and made request
for the performance of the contents thereof.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,18);</script>Therefore what things
soever were meet to be reported to the king, I have declared them, and he
hath granted as much as might be.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,19);</script>And if then ye will
keep yourselves loyal to the state, hereafter also will I endeavour to be
a means of your good.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,20);</script>But of the
particulars I have given order both to these and the other that came from
me, to commune with you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,21);</script>Fare ye well. The
hundred and eight and fortieth year, the four and twentieth day of the
month Dioscorinthius.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,22);</script>Now the king’s
letter contained these words: King Antiochus unto his brother Lysias
sendeth greeting:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,23);</script>Since our father is
translated unto the gods, our will is, that they that are in our realm
live quietly, that every one may attend upon his own affairs.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,24);</script>We understand also
that the Jews would not consent to our father, for to be brought unto the
custom of the Gentiles, but had rather keep their own manner of living:
for the which cause they require of us, that we should suffer them to live
after their own laws.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,25);</script>Wherefore our mind
is, that this nation shall be in rest, and we have determined to restore
them their temple, that they may live according to the customs of their
forefathers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,26);</script>Thou shalt do well
therefore to send unto them, and grant them peace, that when they are
certified of our mind, they may be of good comfort, and ever go cheerfully
about their own affairs.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,27);</script>And the letter of the
king unto the nation of the Jews was after this manner: King Antiochus
sendeth greeting unto the council, and the rest of the Jews:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,28);</script>If ye fare well, we
have our desire; we are also in good health.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,29);</script>Menelaus declared
unto us, that your desire was to return home, and to follow your own
business:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,30);</script>Wherefore they that
will depart shall have safe conduct till the thirtieth day of Xanthicus
with security.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,31);</script>And the Jews shall
use their own kind of meats and laws, as before; and none of them any
manner of ways shall be molested for things ignorantly done.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,32);</script>I have sent also
Menelaus, that he may comfort you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,33);</script>Fare ye well. In the
hundred forty and eighth year, and the fifteenth day of the month
Xanthicus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,34);</script>The Romans also sent
unto them a letter containing these words: Quintus Memmius and Titus
Manlius, ambassadors of the Romans, send greeting unto the people of the
Jews.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,35);</script>Whatsoever Lysias the
king’s cousin hath granted, therewith we also are well pleased.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,36);</script>But touching such
things as he judged to be referred to the king, after ye have advised
thereof, send one forthwith, that we may declare as it is convenient for
you: for we are now going to Antioch.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,37);</script>Therefore send some
with speed, that we may know what is your mind.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,38);</script>Farewell. This
hundred and eight and fortieth year, the fifteenth day of the month
Xanthicus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>When these covenants
were made, Lysias went unto the king, and the Jews were about their
husbandry.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,2);</script>But of the governours
of several places, Timotheus, and Apollonius the son of Genneus, also
Hieronymus, and Demophon, and beside them Nicanor the governor of Cyprus,
would not suffer them to be quiet and live in peace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,3);</script>The men of Joppa also
did such an ungodly deed: they prayed the Jews that dwelt among them to go
with their wives and children into the boats which they had prepared, as
though they had meant them no hurt.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,4);</script>Who accepted of it
according to the common decree of the city, as being desirous to live in
peace, and suspecting nothing: but when they were gone forth into the
deep, they drowned no less than two hundred of them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,5);</script>When Judas heard of
this cruelty done unto his countrymen, he commanded those that were with
him to make them ready.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,6);</script>And calling upon God
the righteous Judge, he came against those murderers of his brethren, and
burnt the haven by night, and set the boats on fire, and those that fled
thither he slew.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,7);</script>And when the town was
shut up, he went backward, as if he would return to root out all them of
the city of Joppa.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,8);</script>But when he heard that
the Jamnites were minded to do in like manner unto the Jews that dwelt
among them,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,9);</script>He came upon the
Jamnites also by night, and set fire on the haven and the navy, so that
the light of the fire was seen at Jerusalem two hundred and forty furlongs
off.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,10);</script>Now when they were
gone from thence nine furlongs in their journey toward Timotheus, no fewer
than five thousand men on foot and five hundred horsemen of the Arabians
set upon him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,11);</script>Whereupon there was a
very sore battle; but Judas’ side by the help of God got the victory; so
that the Nomades of Arabia, being overcome, besought Judas for peace,
promising both to give him cattle, and to pleasure him otherwise.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,12);</script>Then Judas, thinking
indeed that they would be profitable in many things, granted them peace:
whereupon they shook hands, and so they departed to their tents.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,13);</script>He went also about to
make a bridge to a certain strong city, which was fenced about with walls,
and inhabited by people of divers countries; and the name of it was Caspis.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,14);</script>But they that were
within it put such trust in the strength of the walls and provision of
victuals, that they behaved themselves rudely toward them that were with
Judas, railing and blaspheming, and uttering such words as were not to be
spoken.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,15);</script>Wherefore Judas with
his company, calling upon the great Lord of the world, who without rams or
engines of war did cast down Jericho in the time of Joshua, gave a fierce
assault against the walls,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,16);</script>And took the city by
the will of God, and made unspeakable slaughters, insomuch that a lake two
furlongs broad near adjoining thereunto, being filled full, was seen
running with blood.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,17);</script>Then departed they
from thence seven hundred and fifty furlongs, and came to Characa unto the
Jews that are called Tubieni.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,18);</script>But as for Timotheus,
they found him not in the places: for before he had dispatched any thing,
he departed from thence, having left a very strong garrison in a certain
hold.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,19);</script>Howbeit Dositheus and
Sosipater, who were of Maccabeus’ captains, went forth, and slew those
that Timotheus had left in the fortress, above ten thousand men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,20);</script>And Maccabeus ranged
his army by bands, and set them over the bands, and went against
Timotheus, who had about him an hundred and twenty thousand men of foot,
and two thousand and five hundred horsemen.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,21);</script>Now when Timotheus
had knowledge of Judas’ coming, he sent the women and children and the
other baggage unto a fortress called Carnion: for the town was hard to
besiege, and uneasy to come unto, by reason of the straitness of all the
places.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,22);</script>But when Judas his
first band came in sight, the enemies, being smitten with fear and terror
through the appearing of him who seeth all things, fled amain, one running
into this way, another that way, so as that they were often hurt of their
own men, and wounded with the points of their own swords.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,23);</script>Judas also was very
earnest in pursuing them, killing those wicked wretches, of whom he slew
about thirty thousand men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,24);</script>Moreover Timotheus
himself fell into the hands of Dositheus and Sosipater, whom he besought
with much craft to let him go with his life, because he had many of the
Jews’ parents, and the brethren of some of them, who, if they put him to
death, should not be regarded.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,25);</script>So when he had
assured them with many words that he would restore them without hurt,
according to the agreement, they let him go for the saving of their
brethren.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,26);</script>Then Maccabeus
marched forth to Carnion, and to the temple of Atargatis, and there he
slew five and twenty thousand persons.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,27);</script>And after he had put
to flight and destroyed them, Judas removed the host toward Ephron, a
strong city, wherein Lysias abode, and a great multitude of divers
nations, and the strong young men kept the walls, and defended them
mightily: wherein also was great provision of engines and darts.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,28);</script>But when Judas and
his company had called upon Almighty God, who with his power breaketh the
strength of his enemies, they won the city, and slew twenty and five
thousand of them that were within,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,29);</script>From thence they
departed to Scythopolis, which lieth six hundred furlongs from Jerusalem,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,30);</script>But when the Jews
that dwelt there had testified that the Scythopolitans dealt lovingly with
them, and entreated them kindly in the time of their adversity;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,31);</script>They gave them
thanks, desiring them to be friendly still unto them: and so they came to
Jerusalem, the feast of the weeks approaching.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,32);</script>And after the feast,
called Pentecost, they went forth against Gorgias the governor of Idumea,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,33);</script>Who came out with
three thousand men of foot and four hundred horsemen.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,34);</script>And it happened that
in their fighting together a few of the Jews were slain.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,35);</script>At which time
Dositheus, one of Bacenor’s company, who was on horseback, and a strong
man, was still upon Gorgias, and taking hold of his coat drew him by
force; and when he would have taken that cursed man alive, a horseman of
Thracia coming upon him smote off his shoulder, so that Gorgias fled unto
Marisa.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,36);</script>Now when they that
were with Gorgias had fought long, and were weary, Judas called upon the
Lord, that he would shew himself to be their helper and leader of the
battle.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,37);</script>And with that he
began in his own language, and sung psalms with a loud voice, and rushing
unawares upon Gorgias’ men, he put them to flight.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,38);</script>So Judas gathered his
host, and came into the city of Odollam, And when the seventh day came,
they purified themselves, as the custom was, and kept the sabbath in the
same place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,39);</script>And upon the day
following, as the use had been, Judas and his company came to take up the
bodies of them that were slain, and to bury them with their kinsmen in
their fathers’ graves.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,40);</script>Now under the coats
of every one that was slain they found things consecrated to the idols of
the Jamnites, which is forbidden the Jews by the law. Then every man saw
that this was the cause wherefore they were slain.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,41);</script>All men therefore
praising the Lord, the righteous Judge, who had opened the things that
were hid,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,42);</script>Betook themselves
unto prayer, and besought him that the sin committed might wholly be put
out of remembrance. Besides, that noble Judas exhorted the people to keep
themselves from sin, forsomuch as they saw before their eyes the things
that came to pass for the sins of those that were slain.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,43);</script>And when he had made
a gathering throughout the company to the sum of two thousand drachms of
silver, he sent it to Jerusalem to offer a sin offering, doing therein
very well and honestly, in that he was mindful of the resurrection:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,44);</script>For if he had not
hoped that they that were slain should have risen again, it had been
superfluous and vain to pray for the dead.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,45);</script>And also in that he
perceived that there was great favour laid up for those that died godly,
it was an holy and good thought. Whereupon he made a reconciliation for
the dead, that they might be delivered from sin.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,1);</script>In the hundred forty
and ninth year it was told Judas, that Antiochus Eupator was coming with a
great power into Judea,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,2);</script>And with him Lysias
his protector, and ruler of his affairs, having either of them a Grecian
power of footmen, an hundred and ten thousand, and horsemen five thousand
and three hundred, and elephants two and twenty, and three hundred
chariots armed with hooks.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,3);</script>Menelaus also joined
himself with them, and with great dissimulation encouraged Antiochus, not
for the safeguard of the country, but because he thought to have been made
governor.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,4);</script>But the King of kings
moved Antiochus’ mind against this wicked wretch, and Lysias informed
the king that this man was the cause of all mischief, so that the king
commanded to bring him unto Berea, and to put him to death, as the manner
is in that place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,5);</script>Now there was in that
place a tower of fifty cubits high, full of ashes, and it had a round
instrument which on every side hanged down into the ashes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,6);</script>And whosoever was
condemned of sacrilege, or had committed any other grievous crime, there
did all men thrust him unto death.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,7);</script>Such a death it
happened that wicked man to die, not having so much as burial in the
earth; and that most justly:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,8);</script>For inasmuch as he had
committed many sins about the altar, whose fire and ashes were holy, he
received his death in ashes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,9);</script>Now the king came with
a barbarous and haughty mind to do far worse to the Jews, than had been
done in his father’s time.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,10);</script>Which things when
Judas perceived, he commanded the multitude to call upon the Lord night
and day, that if ever at any other time, he would now also help them,
being at the point to be put from their law, from their country, and from
the holy temple:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,11);</script>And that he would not
suffer the people, that had even now been but a little refreshed, to be in
subjection to the blasphemous nations.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,12);</script>So when they had all
done this together, and besought the merciful Lord with weeping and
fasting, and lying flat upon the ground three days long, Judas, having
exhorted them, commanded they should be in a readiness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,13);</script>And Judas, being
apart with the elders, determined, before the king’s host should enter
into Judea, and get the city, to go forth and try the matter in fight by
the help of the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,14);</script>So when he had
committed all to the Creator of the world, and exhorted his soldiers to
fight manfully, even unto death, for the laws, the temple, the city, the
country, and the commonwealth, he camped by Modin:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,15);</script>And having given the
watchword to them that were about him, Victory is of God; with the most
valiant and choice young men he went in into the king’s tent by night,
and slew in the camp about four thousand men, and the chiefest of the
elephants, with all that were upon him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,16);</script>And at last they
filled the camp with fear and tumult, and departed with good success.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,17);</script>This was done in the
break of the day, because the protection of the Lord did help him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,18);</script>Now when the king had
taken a taste of the manliness of the Jews, he went about to take the
holds by policy,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,19);</script>And marched toward
Bethsura, which was a strong hold of the Jews: but he was put to flight,
failed, and lost of his men:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,20);</script>For Judas had
conveyed unto them that were in it such things as were necessary.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,21);</script>But Rhodocus, who was
in the Jews’ host, disclosed the secrets to the enemies; therefore he
was sought out, and when they had gotten him, they put him in prison.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,22);</script>The king treated with
them in Bethsum the second time, gave his hand, took their’s, departed,
fought with Judas, was overcome;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,23);</script>Heard that Philip,
who was left over the affairs in Antioch, was desperately bent,
confounded, intreated the Jews, submitted himself, and sware to all equal
conditions, agreed with them, and offered sacrifice, honoured the temple,
and dealt kindly with the place,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,24);</script>And accepted well of
Maccabeus, made him principal governor from Ptolemais unto the Gerrhenians;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,25);</script>Came to Ptolemais:
the people there were grieved for the covenants; for they stormed, because
they would make their covenants void:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,26);</script>Lysias went up to the
judgment seat, said as much as could be in defence of the cause,
persuaded, pacified, made them well affected, returned to Antioch. Thus it
went touching the king’s coming and departing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,1);</script>After three years was
Judas informed, that Demetrius the son of Seleucus, having entered by the
haven of Tripolis with a great power and navy,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,2);</script>Had taken the country,
and killed Antiochus, and Lysias his protector.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,3);</script>Now one Alcimus, who
had been high priest, and had defiled himself wilfully in the times of
their mingling with the Gentiles, seeing that by no means he could save
himself, nor have any more access to the holy altar,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,4);</script>Came to king Demetrius
in the hundred and one and fiftieth year, presenting unto him a crown of
gold, and a palm, and also of the boughs which were used solemnly in the
temple: and so that day he held his peace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>Howbeit having gotten
opportunity to further his foolish enterprize, and being called into
counsel by Demetrius, and asked how the Jews stood affected, and what they
intended, he answered thereunto:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>Those of the Jews that
he called Assideans, whose captain is Judas Maccabeus, nourish war and are
seditious, and will not let the rest be in peace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,7);</script>Therefore I, being
deprived of mine ancestors’ honour, I mean the high priesthood, am now
come hither:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,8);</script>First, verily for the
unfeigned care I have of things pertaining to the king; and secondly, even
for that I intend the good of mine own countrymen: for all our nation is
in no small misery through the unadvised dealing of them aforersaid.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,9);</script>Wherefore, O king,
seeing knowest all these things, be careful for the country, and our
nation, which is pressed on every side, according to the clemency that
thou readily shewest unto all.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,10);</script>For as long as Judas
liveth, it is not possible that the state should be quiet.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,11);</script>This was no sooner
spoken of him, but others of the king’s friends, being maliciously set
against Judas, did more incense Demetrius.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,12);</script>And forthwith calling
Nicanor, who had been master of the elephants, and making him governor
over Judea, he sent him forth,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,13);</script>Commanding him to
slay Judas, and to scatter them that were with him, and to make Alcimus
high priest of the great temple.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,14);</script>Then the heathen,
that had fled out of Judea from Judas, came to Nicanor by flocks, thinking
the harm and calamities ot the Jews to be their welfare.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,15);</script>Now when the Jews
heard of Nicanor’s coming, and that the heathen were up against them,
they cast earth upon their heads, and made supplication to him that had
established his people for ever, and who always helpeth his portion with
manifestation of his presence.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,16);</script>So at the commandment
of the captain they removed straightways from thence, and came near unto
them at the town of Dessau.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,17);</script>Now Simon, Judas’
brother, had joined battle with Nicanor, but was somewhat discomfited
through the sudden silence of his enemies.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,18);</script>Nevertheless Nicanor,
hearing of the manliness of them that were with Judas, and the
courageousness that they had to fight for their country, durst not try the
matter by the sword.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,19);</script>Wherefore he sent
Posidonius, and Theodotus, and Mattathias, to make peace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,20);</script>So when they had
taken long advisement thereupon, and the captain had made the multitude
acquainted therewith, and it appeared that they were all of one mind, they
consented to the covenants,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,21);</script>And appointed a day
to meet in together by themselves: and when the day came, and stools were
set for either of them,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,22);</script>Ludas placed armed
men ready in convenient places, lest some treachery should be suddenly
practised by the enemies: so they made a peaceable conference.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,23);</script>Now Nicanor abode in
Jerusalem, and did no hurt, but sent away the people that came flocking
unto him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,24);</script>And he would not
willingly have Judas out of his sight: for he love the man from his heart
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,25);</script>He prayed him also to
take a wife, and to beget children: so he married, was quiet, and took
part of this life.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,26);</script>But Alcimus,
perceiving the love that was betwixt them, and considering the covenants
that were made, came to Demetrius, and told him that Nicanor was not well
affected toward the state; for that he had ordained Judas, a traitor to
his realm, to be the king’s successor.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,27);</script>Then the king being
in a rage, and provoked with the accusations of the most wicked man, wrote
to Nicanor, signifying that he was much displeased with the covenants, and
commanding him that he should send Maccabeus prisoner in all haste unto
Antioch.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,28);</script>When this came to
Nicanor’s hearing, he was much confounded in himself, and took it
grievously that he should make void the articles which were agreed upon,
the man being in no fault.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,29);</script>But because there was
no dealing against the king, he watched his time to accomplish this thing
by policy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,30);</script>Notwithstanding, when
Maccabeus saw that Nicanor began to be churlish unto him, and that he
entreated him more roughly than he was wont, perceiving that such sour
behaviour came not of good, he gathered together not a few of his men, and
withdrew himself from Nicanor.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,31);</script>But the other,
knowing that he was notably prevented by Judas’ policy, came into the
great and holy temple, and commanded the priests, that were offering their
usual sacrifices, to deliver him the man.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,32);</script>And when they sware
that they could not tell where the man was whom he sought,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,33);</script>He stretched out his
right hand toward the temple, and made an oath in this manner: If ye will
not deliver me Judas as a prisoner, I will lay this temple of God even
with the ground, and I will break down the altar, and erect a notable
temple unto Bacchus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,34);</script>After these words he
departed. Then the priests lifted up their hands toward heaven, and
besought him that was ever a defender of their nation, saying in this
manner;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,35);</script>Thou, O Lord of all
things, who hast need of nothing, wast pleased that the temple of thine
habitation should be among us:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,36);</script>Therefore now, O holy
Lord of all holiness, keep this house ever undefiled, which lately was
cleansed, and stop every unrighteous mouth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,37);</script>Now was there accused
unto Nicanor one Razis, one of the elders of Jerusalem, a lover of his
countrymen, and a man of very good report, who for his kindness was called
a father of the Jews.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,38);</script>For in the former
times, when they mingled not themselves with the Gentiles, he had been
accused of Judaism, and did boldly jeopard his body and life with all
vehemency for the religion of the Jews.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,39);</script>So Nicanor, willing
to declare the hate that he bare unto the Jews, sent above five hundred
men of war to take him:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,40);</script>For he thought by
taking him to do the Jews much hurt.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,41);</script>Now when the
multitude would have taken the tower, and violently broken into the outer
door, and bade that fire should be brought to burn it, he being ready to
be taken on every side fell upon his sword;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,42);</script>Choosing rather to
die manfully, than to come into the hands of the wicked, to be abused
otherwise than beseemed his noble birth:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,43);</script>But missing his
stroke through haste, the multitude also rushing within the doors, he ran
boldly up to the wall, and cast himself down manfully among the thickest
of them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,44);</script>But they quickly
giving back, and a space being made, he fell down into the midst of the
void place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,45);</script>Nevertheless, while
there was yet breath within him, being inflamed with anger, he rose up;
and though his blood gushed out like spouts of water, and his wounds were
grievous, yet he ran through the midst of the throng; and standing upon a
steep rock,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,46);</script>When as his blood was
now quite gone, he plucked out his bowels, and taking them in both his
hands, he cast them upon the throng, and calling upon the Lord of life and
spirit to restore him those again, he thus died.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,1);</script>But Nicanor, hearing
that Judas and his company were in the strong places about Samaria,
resolved without any danger to set upon them on the sabbath day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,2);</script>Nevertheless the Jews
that were compelled to go with him said, O destroy not so cruelly and
barbarously, but give honour to that day, which he, that seeth all things,
hath honoured with holiness above all other days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,3);</script>Then the most
ungracious wretch demanded, if there were a Mighty one in heaven, that had
commanded the sabbath day to be kept.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,4);</script>And when they said,
There is in heaven a living Lord, and mighty, who commanded the seventh
day to be kept:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,5);</script>Then said the other,
And I also am mighty upon earth, and I command to take arms, and to do the
king’s business. Yet he obtained not to have his wicked will done.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,6);</script>So Nicanor in
exceeding pride and haughtiness determined to set up a publick monument of
his victory over Judas and them that were with him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,7);</script>But Maccabeus had ever
sure confidence that the Lord would help him:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,8);</script>Wherefore he exhorted
his people not to fear the coming of the heathen against them, but to
remember the help which in former times they had received from heaven, and
now to expect the victory and aid, which should come unto them from the
Almighty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,9);</script>And so comforting them
out of the law and the prophets, and withal putting them in mind of the
battles that they won afore, he made them more cheerful.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,10);</script>And when he had
stirred up their minds, he gave them their charge, shewing them
therewithall the falsehood of the heathen, and the breach of oaths.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,11);</script>Thus he armed every
one of them, not so much with defence of shields and spears, as with
comfortable and good words: and beside that, he told them a dream worthy
to be believed, as if it had been so indeed, which did not a little
rejoice them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,12);</script>And this was his
vision: That Onias, who had been high priest, a virtuous and a good man,
reverend in conversation, gentle in condition, well spoken also, and
exercised from a child in all points of virtue, holding up his hands
prayed for the whole body of the Jews.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,13);</script>This done, in like
manner there appeared a man with gray hairs, and exceeding glorious, who
was of a wonderful and excellent majesty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,14);</script>Then Onias answered,
saying, This is a lover of the brethren, who prayeth much for the people,
and for the holy city, to wit, Jeremias the prophet of God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,15);</script>Whereupon Jeremias
holding forth his right hand gave to Judas a sword of gold, and in giving
it spake thus,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,16);</script>Take this holy sword,
a gift from God, with the which thou shalt wound the adversaries.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,17);</script>Thus being well
comforted by the words of Judas, which were very good, and able to stir
them up to valour, and to encourage the hearts of the young men, they
determined not to pitch camp, but courageously to set upon them, and
manfully to try the matter by conflict, because the city and the sanctuary
and the temple were in danger.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,18);</script>For the care that
they took for their wives, and their children, their brethren, and folks,
was in least account with them: but the greatest and principal fear was
for the holy temple.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,19);</script>Also they that were
in the city took not the least care, being troubled for the conflict
abroad.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,20);</script>And now, when as all
looked what should be the trial, and the enemies were already come near,
and the army was set in array, and the beasts conveniently placed, and the
horsemen set in wings,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,21);</script>Maccabeus seeing the
coming of the multitude, and the divers preparations of armour, and the
fierceness of the beasts, stretched out his hands toward heaven, and
called upon the Lord that worketh wonders, knowing that victory cometh not
by arms, but even as it seemeth good to him, he giveth it to such as are
worthy:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,22);</script>Therefore in his
prayer he said after this manner; O Lord, thou didst send thine angel in
the time of Ezekias king of Judea, and didst slay in the host of
Sennacherib an hundred fourscore and five thousand:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,23);</script>Wherefore now also, O
Lord of heaven, send a good angel before us for a fear and dread unto them;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,24);</script>And through the might
of thine arm let those be stricken with terror, that come against thy holy
people to blaspheme. And he ended thus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,25);</script>Then Nicanor and they
that were with him came forward with trumpets and songs.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,26);</script>But Judas and his
company encountered the enemies with invocation and prayer.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,27);</script>So that fighting with
their hands, and praying unto God with their hearts, they slew no less
than thirty and five thousand men: for through the appearance of God they
were greatly cheered.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,28);</script>Now when the battle
was done, returning again with joy, they knew that Nicanor lay dead in his
harness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,29);</script>Then they made a
great shout and a noise, praising the Almighty in their own language.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,30);</script>And Judas, who was
ever the chief defender of the citizens both in body and mind, and who
continued his love toward his countrymen all his life, commanded to strike
off Nicanor’s head, and his hand with his shoulder, and bring them to
Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,31);</script>So when he was there,
and called them of his nation together, and set the priests before the
altar, he sent for them that were of the tower,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,32);</script>And shewed them vile
Nicanor’s head, and the hand of that blasphemer, which with proud brags
he had stretched out against the holy temple of the Almighty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,33);</script>And when he had cut
out the tongue of that ungodly Nicanor, he commanded that they should give
it by pieces unto the fowls, and hang up the reward of his madness before
the temple.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,34);</script>So every man praised
toward the heaven the glorious Lord, saying, Blessed be he that hath kept
his own place undefiled.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,35);</script>He hanged also
Nicanor’s head upon the tower, an evident and manifest sign unto all of
the help of the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,36);</script>And they ordained all
with a common decree in no case to let that day pass without solemnity,
but to celebrate the thirtieth day of the twelfth month, which in the
Syrian tongue is called Adar, the day before Mardocheus’ day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,37);</script>Thus went it with
Nicanor: and from that time forth the Hebrews had the city in their power.
And here will I make an end.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,38);</script>And if I have done
well, and as is fitting the story, it is that which I desired: but if
slenderly and meanly, it is that which I could attain unto.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,39);</script>For as it is hurtful
to drink wine or water alone; and as wine mingled with water is pleasant,
and delighteth the taste: even so speech finely framed delighteth the ears
of them that read the story. And here shall be an end.
