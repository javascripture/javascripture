The Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach,or Ecclesiasticus
</h1><p>
A Prologue made by an uncertain Author
<p>This Jesus was the son of Sirach, and grandchild to Jesus of the same
name with him: this man therefore lived in the latter times, after the
people had been led away captive, and called home a again, and almost
after all the prophets. Now his grandfather Jesus, as he himself
witnesseth, was a man of great diligence and wisdom among the Hebrews, who
did not only gather the grave and short sentences of wise men, that had
been before him, but himself also uttered some of his own, full of much
understanding and wisdom. When as therefore the first Jesus died, leaving
this book almost perfected, Sirach his son receiving it after him left it
to his own son Jesus, who, having gotten it into his hands, compiled it
all orderly into one volume, and called it Wisdom, intituling it both by
his own name, his father’s name, and his grandfather’s; alluring the
hearer by the very name of Wisdom to have a greater love to the study of
this book. It containeth therefore wise sayings, dark sentences, and
parables, and certain particular ancient godly stories of men that pleased
God; also his prayer and song; moreover, what benefits God had vouchsafed
his people, and what plagues he had heaped upon their enemies. This Jesus
did imitate Solomon, and was no less famous for wisdom and learning, both
being indeed a man of great learning, and so reputed also.
<p>The Prologue of the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach.
<p>Whereas many and great things have been delivered unto us by the law
and the prophets, and by others that have followed their steps, for the
which things Israel ought to be commended for learning and wisdom; and
whereof not only the readers must needs become skilful themselves, but
also they that desire to learn be able to profit them which are without,
both by speaking and writing: my grandfather Jesus, when he had much given
himself to the reading of the law, and the prophets, and other books of
our fathers, and had gotten therein good judgment, was drawn on also
himself to write something pertaining to learning and wisdom; to the
intent that those which are desirous to learn, and are addicted to these
things, might profit much more in living according to the law. Wherefore
let me intreat you to read it with favour and attention, and to pardon us,
wherein we may seem to come short of some words, which we have laboured to
interpret. For the same things uttered in Hebrew, and translated into
another tongue, have not the same force in them: and not only these
things, but the law itself, and the prophets, and the rest of the books,
have no small difference, when they are spoken in their own language. For
in the eight and thirtieth year coming into Egypt, when Euergetes was
king, and continuing there some time, I found a book of no small learning:
therefore I thought it most necessary for me to bestow some diligence and
travail to interpret it; using great watchfulness and skill in that space
to bring the book to an end, and set it forth for them also, which in a
strange country are willing to learn, being prepared before in manners to
live after the law.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>All wisdom cometh from
the Lord, and is with him for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>Who can number the sand
of the sea, and the drops of rain, and the days of eternity?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>Who can find out the
height of heaven, and the breadth of the earth, and the deep, and wisdom?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>Wisdom hath been
created before all things, and the understanding of prudence from
everlasting.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>The word of God most
high is the fountain of wisdom; and her ways are everlasting commandments.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>To whom hath the root
of wisdom been revealed? or who hath known her wise counsels?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script><I>Unto whom hath the
knowledge of wisdom been made manifest? and who hath understood her great
experience?</I>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>There is one wise and
greatly to be feared, the Lord sitting upon his throne.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>He created her, and saw
her, and numbered her, and poured her out upon all his works.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>She is with all flesh
according to his gift, and he hath given her to them that love him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>The fear of the Lord
is honour, and glory, and gladness, and a crown of rejoicing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>The fear of the Lord
maketh a merry heart, and giveth joy, and gladness, and a long life.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>Whoso feareth the
Lord, it shall go well with him at the last, and he shall find favour in
the day of his death.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>To fear the Lord is
the beginning of wisdom: and it was created with the faithful in the womb.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>She hath built an
everlasting foundation with men, and she shall continue with their seed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>To fear the Lord is
fulness of wisdom, and filleth men with her fruits.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>She filleth all their
house with things desirable, and the garners with her increase.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>The fear of the Lord
is a crown of wisdom, making peace and perfect health to flourish; both
which are the gifts of God: and it enlargeth their rejoicing that love him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>Wisdom raineth down
skill and knowledge of understanding standing, and exalteth them to honour
that hold her fast.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>The root of wisdom is
to fear the Lord, and the branches thereof are long life.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>The fear of the Lord
driveth away sins: and where it is present, it turneth away wrath.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>A furious man cannot
be justified; for the sway of his fury shall be his destruction.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,23);</script>A patient man will
tear for a time, and afterward joy shall spring up unto him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,24);</script>He will hide his words
for a time, and the lips of many shall declare his wisdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,25);</script>The parables of
knowledge are in the treasures of wisdom: but godliness is an abomination
to a sinner.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,26);</script>If thou desire wisdom,
keep the commandments, and the Lord shall give her unto thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,27);</script>For the fear of the
Lord is wisdom and instruction: and faith and meekness are his delight.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,28);</script>Distrust not the fear
of the Lord when thou art poor: and come not unto him with a double heart.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,29);</script>Be not an hypocrite in
the sight of men, and take good heed what thou speakest.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,30);</script>Exalt not thyself,
lest thou fall, and bring dishonour upon thy soul, and so God discover thy
secrets, and cast thee down in the midst of the congregation, because thou
camest not in truth to the fear of the Lord, but thy heart is full of
deceit.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>My son, if thou come to
serve the Lord, prepare thy soul for temptation.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>Set thy heart aright,
and constantly endure, and make not haste in time of trouble.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>Cleave unto him, and
depart not away, that thou mayest be increased at thy last end.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>Whatsoever is brought
upon thee take cheerfully, and be patient when thou art changed to a low
estate.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>For gold is tried in
the fire, and acceptable men in the furnace of adversity.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>Believe in him, and he
will help thee; order thy way aright, and trust in him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>Ye that fear the Lord,
wait for his mercy; and go not aside, lest ye fall.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>Ye that fear the Lord,
believe him; and your reward shall not fail.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>Ye that fear the Lord,
hope for good, and for everlasting joy and mercy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>Look at the
generations of old, and see; did ever any trust in the Lord, and was
confounded? or did any abide in his fear, and was forsaken? or whom did he
ever despise, that called upon him?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>For the Lord is full
of compassion and mercy, longsuffering, and very pitiful, and forgiveth
sins, and saveth in time of affliction.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>Woe be to fearful
hearts, and faint hands, and the sinner that goeth two ways!
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>Woe unto him that is
fainthearted! for he believeth not; therefore shall he not be defended.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>Woe unto you that have
lost patience! and what will ye do when the Lord shall visit you?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>They that fear the
Lord will not disobey his Word; and they that love him will keep his ways.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>They that fear the
Lord will seek that which is well, pleasing unto him; and they that love
him shall be filled with the law.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>They that fear the
Lord will prepare their hearts, and humble their souls in his sight,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>Saying, We will fall
into the hands of the Lord, and not into the hands of men: for as his
majesty is, so is his mercy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>Hear me your father, O
children, and do thereafter, that ye may be safe.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>For the Lord hath given
the father honour over the children, and hath confirmed the authority of
the mother over the sons.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>Whoso honoureth his
father maketh an atonement for his sins:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>And he that honoureth
his mother is as one that layeth up treasure.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>Whoso honoureth his
father shall have joy of his own children; and when he maketh his prayer,
he shall be heard.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>He that honoureth his
father shall have a long life; and he that is obedient unto the Lord shall
be a comfort to his mother.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>He that feareth the
Lord will honour his father, and will do service unto his parents, as to
his masters.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>Honour thy father and
mother both in word and deed, that a blessing may come upon thee from them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>For the blessing of the
father establisheth the houses of children; but the curse of the mother
rooteth out foundations.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>Glory not in the
dishonour of thy father; for thy father’s dishonour is no glory unto
thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>For the glory of a man
is from the honour of his father; and a mother in dishonour is a reproach
to the children.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>My son, help thy
father in his age, and grieve him not as long as he liveth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>And if his
understanding fail, have patience with him; and despise him not when thou
art in thy full strength.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>For the relieving of
thy father shall not be forgotten: and instead of sins it shall be added
to build thee up.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>In the day of thine
affliction it shall be remembered; thy sins also shall melt away, as the
ice in the fair warm weather.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>He that forsaketh his
father is as a blasphemer; and he that angereth his mother is cursed: of
God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>My son, go on with thy
business in meekness; so shalt thou be beloved of him that is approved.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,18);</script>The greater thou art,
the more humble thyself, and thou shalt find favour before the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,19);</script>Many are in high
place, and of renown: but mysteries are revealed unto the meek.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,20);</script>For the power of the
Lord is great, and he is honoured of the lowly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,21);</script>Seek not out things
that are too hard for thee, neither search the things that are above thy
strength.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,22);</script>But what is commanded
thee, think thereupon with reverence, for it is not needful for thee to
see with thine eyes the things that are in secret.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,23);</script>Be not curious in
unnecessary matters: for more things are shewed unto thee than men
understand.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,24);</script>For many are deceived
by their own vain opinion; and an evil suspicion hath overthrown their
judgment.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,25);</script>Without eyes thou
shalt want light: profess not the knowledge therefore that thou hast not.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,26);</script>A stubborn heart shall
fare evil at the last; and he that loveth danger shall perish therein.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,27);</script>An obstinate heart
shall be laden with sorrows; and the wicked man shall heap sin upon sin.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,28);</script>In the punishment of
the proud there is no remedy; for the plant of wickedness hath taken root
in him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,29);</script>The heart of the
prudent will understand a parable; and an attentive ear is the desire of a
wise man.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,30);</script>Water will quench a
flaming fire; and alms maketh an atonement for sins.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,31);</script>And he that requiteth
good turns is mindful of that which may come hereafter; and when he
falleth, he shall find a stay.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>My son, defraud not the
poor of his living, and make not the needy eyes to wait long.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>Make not an hungry soul
sorrowful; neither provoke a man in his distress.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script>Add not more trouble to
an heart that is vexed; and defer not to give to him that is in need.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,4);</script>Reject not the
supplication of the afflicted; neither turn away thy face from a poor man.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,5);</script>Turn not away thine eye
from the needy, and give him none occasion to curse thee:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,6);</script>For if he curse thee in
the bitterness of his soul, his prayer shall be heard of him that made him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,7);</script>Get thyself the love of
the congregation, and bow thy head to a great man.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,8);</script>Let it not grieve thee
to bow down thine ear to the poor, and give him a friendly answer with
meekness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>Deliver him that
suffereth wrong from the hand of the oppressor; and be not fainthearted
when thou sittest in judgment.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>Be as a father unto
the fatherless, and instead of an husband unto their mother: so shalt thou
be as the son of the most High, and he shall love thee more than thy
mother doth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>Wisdom exalteth her
children, and layeth hold of them that seek her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,12);</script>He that loveth her
loveth life; and they that seek to her early shall be filled with joy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,13);</script>He that holdeth her
fast shall inherit glory; and wheresoever she entereth, the Lord will
bless.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,14);</script>They that serve her
shall minister to the Holy One: and them that love her the Lord doth love.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,15);</script>Whoso giveth ear unto
her shall judge the nations: and he that attendeth unto her shall dwell
securely.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,16);</script>If a man commit
himself unto her, he shall inherit her; and his generation shall hold her
in possession.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,17);</script>For at the first she
will walk with him by crooked ways, and bring fear and dread upon him, and
torment him with her discipline, until she may trust his soul, and try him
by her laws.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,18);</script>Then will she return
the straight way unto him, and comfort him, and shew him her secrets.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,19);</script>But if he go wrong,
she will forsake him, and give him over to his own ruin.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,20);</script>Observe the
opportunity, and beware of evil; and be not ashamed when it concerneth thy
soul.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>For there is a shame
that bringeth sin; and there is a shame which is glory and grace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,22);</script>Accept no person
against thy soul, and let not the reverence of any man cause thee to fall.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,23);</script>And refrain not to
speak, when there is occasion to do good, and hide not thy wisdom in her
beauty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,24);</script>For by speech wisdom
shall be known: and learning by the word of the tongue.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,25);</script>In no wise speak
against the truth; but be abashed of the error of thine ignorance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,26);</script>Be not ashamed to
confess thy sins; and force not the course of the river.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,27);</script>Make not thyself an
underling to a foolish man; neither accept the person of the mighty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,28);</script>Strive for the truth
unto death, and the Lord shall fight for thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,29);</script>Be not hasty in thy
tongue, and in thy deeds slack and remiss.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,30);</script>Be not as a lion in
thy house, nor frantick among thy servants.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,31);</script>Let not thine hand be
stretched out to receive, and shut when thou shouldest repay.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>Set thy heart upon thy
goods; and say not, I have enough for my life.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>Follow not thine own
mind and thy strength, to walk in the ways of thy heart:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>And say not, Who shall
controul me for my works? for the Lord will surely revenge thy pride.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>Say not, I have sinned,
and what harm hath happened unto me? for the Lord is longsuffering, he
will in no wise let thee go.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>Concerning
propitiation, be not without fear to add sin unto sin:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>And say not His mercy
is great; he will be pacified for the multitude of my sins: for mercy and
wrath come from him, and his indignation resteth upon sinners.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>Make no tarrying to
turn to the Lord, and put not off from day to day: for suddenly shall the
wrath of the Lord come forth, and in thy security thou shalt be destroyed,
and perish in the day of vengeance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>Set not thine heart
upon goods unjustly gotten, for they shall not profit thee in the day of
calamity.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>Winnow not with every
wind, and go not into every way: for so doth the sinner that hath a double
tongue.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>Be stedfast in thy
understanding; and let thy word be the same.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>Be swift to hear; and
let thy life be sincere; and with patience give answer.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>If thou hast
understanding, answer thy neighbour; if not, lay thy hand upon thy mouth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,13);</script>Honour and shame is in
talk: and the tongue of man is his fall.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,14);</script>Be not called a
whisperer, and lie not in wait with thy tongue: for a foul shame is upon
the thief, and an evil condemnation upon the double tongue.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,15);</script>Be not ignorant of any
thing in a great matter or a small.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>Instead of a friend
become not an enemy; for <I>thereby</I> thou shalt inherit an ill name,
shame, and reproach: even so shall a sinner that hath a double tongue.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>Extol not thyself in
the counsel of thine own heart; that thy soul be not torn in pieces as a
bull <I>straying alone.</I>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>Thou shalt eat up thy
leaves, and lose thy fruit, and leave thyself as a dry tree.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,4);</script>A wicked soul shall
destroy him that hath it, and shall make him to be laughed to scorn of his
enemies.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>Sweet language will
multiply friends: and a fairspeaking tongue will increase kind greetings.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>Be in peace with many:
nevertheless have but one counsellor of a thousand.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>If thou wouldest get a
friend, prove him first and be not hasty to credit him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>For some man is a
friend for his own occasion, and will not abide in the day of thy trouble.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>And there is a friend,
who being turned to enmity, and strife will discover thy reproach.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>Again, some friend is
a companion at the table, and will not continue in the day of thy
affliction.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,11);</script>But in thy prosperity
he will be as thyself, and will be bold over thy servants.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>If thou be brought
low, he will be against thee, and will hide himself from thy face.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>Separate thyself from
thine enemies, and take heed of thy friends.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>A faithfull friend is
a strong defence: and he that hath found such an one hath found a treasure.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>Nothing doth
countervail a faithful friend, and his excellency is invaluable.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,16);</script>A faithful friend is
the medicine of life; and they that fear the Lord shall find him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,17);</script>Whoso feareth the Lord
shall direct his friendship aright: for as he is, so shall his neighbour
be also.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,18);</script>My son, gather
instruction from thy youth up: so shalt thou find wisdom till thine old
age.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,19);</script>Come unto her as one
that ploweth and soweth, and wait for her good fruits: for thou shalt not
toil much in labouring about her, but thou shalt eat of her fruits right
soon.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,20);</script>She is very unpleasant
to the unlearned: he that is without understanding will not remain with
her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,21);</script>She will lie upon him
as a mighty stone of trial; and he will cast her from him ere it be long.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,22);</script>For wisdom is
according to her name, and she is not manifest unto many.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,23);</script>Give ear, my son,
receive my advice, and refuse not my counsel,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,24);</script>And put thy feet into
her fetters, and thy neck into her chain.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,25);</script>Bow down thy shoulder,
and bear her, and be not grieved with her bonds.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,26);</script>Come unto her with thy
whole heart, and keep her ways with all thy power.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,27);</script>Search, and seek, and
she shall be made known unto thee: and when thou hast got hold of her, let
her not go.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,28);</script>For at the last thou
shalt find her rest, and that shall be turned to thy joy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,29);</script>Then shall her fetters
be a strong defence for thee, and her chains a robe of glory.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,30);</script>For there is a golden
ornament upon her, and her bands are purple lace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,31);</script>Thou shalt put her on
as a robe of honour, and shalt put her about thee as a crown of joy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,32);</script>My son, if thou wilt,
thou shalt be taught: and if thou wilt apply thy mind, thou shalt be
prudent.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,33);</script>If thou love to hear,
thou shalt receive understanding: and if thou bow thine ear, thou shalt be
wise,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,34);</script>Stand in the multitude
of the elders; and cleave unto him that is wise.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,35);</script>Be willing to hear
every godly discourse; and let not the parables of understanding escape
thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,36);</script>And if thou seest a
man of understanding, get thee betimes unto him, and let thy foot wear the
steps of his door.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,37);</script>Let thy mind be upon
the ordinances of the Lord and meditate continually in his commandments:
he shall establish thine heart, and give thee wisdom at thine owns desire.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,1);</script>Do no evil, so shall no
harm come unto thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,2);</script>Depart from the unjust,
and iniquity shall turn away from thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,3);</script>My son, sow not upon
the furrows of unrighteousness, and thou shalt not reap them sevenfold.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,4);</script>Seek not of the Lord
preeminence, neither of the king the seat of honour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,5);</script>justify not thyself
before the Lord; and boast not of thy wisdom before the king.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,6);</script>Seek not to be judge,
being not able to take away iniquity; lest at any time thou fear the
person of the mighty, an stumblingblock in the way of thy uprightness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,7);</script>Offend not against the
multitude of a city, and then thou shalt not cast thyself down among the
people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,8);</script>Bind not one sin upon
another; for in one thou shalt not be unpunished.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,9);</script>Say not, God will look
upon the multitude of my oblations, and when I offer to the most high God,
he will accept it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,10);</script>Be not fainthearted
when thou makest thy prayer, and neglect not to give alms.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,11);</script>Laugh no man to scorn
in the bitterness of his soul: for there is one which humbleth and
exalteth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,12);</script>Devise not a lie
against thy brother; neither do the like to thy friend.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,13);</script>Use not to make any
manner of lie: for the custom thereof is not good.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,14);</script>Use not many words in
a multitude of elders, and make not much babbling when thou prayest.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,15);</script>Hate not laborious
work, neither husbandry, which the most High hath ordained.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,16);</script>Number not thyself
among the multitude of sinners, but remember that wrath will not tarry
long.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,17);</script>Humble thyself
greatly: for the vengeance of the ungodly is fire and worms.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,18);</script>Change not a friend
for any good by no means; neither a faithful brother for the gold of Ophir.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,19);</script>Forego not a wise and
good woman: for her grace is above gold.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,20);</script>Whereas thy servant
worketh truly, entreat him not evil. nor the hireling that bestoweth
himself wholly for thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,21);</script>Let thy soul love a
good servant, and defraud him not of liberty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,22);</script>Hast thou cattle? have
an eye to them: and if they be for thy profit, keep them with thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,23);</script>Hast thou children?
instruct them, and bow down their neck from their youth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,24);</script>Hast thou daughters?
have a care of their body, and shew not thyself cheerful toward them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,25);</script>Marry thy daughter,
and so shalt thou have performed a weighty matter: but give her to a man
of understanding.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,26);</script>Hast thou a wife after
thy mind? forsake her not: but give not thyself over to a light woman.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,27);</script>Honour thy father with
thy whole heart, and forget not the sorrows of thy mother.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,28);</script>Remember that thou
wast begotten of them; and how canst thou recompense them the things that
they have done for thee?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,29);</script>Fear the Lord with all
thy soul, and reverence his priests.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,30);</script>Love him that made
thee with all thy strength, and forsake not his ministers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,31);</script>Fear the Lord, and
honor the priest; and give him his portion, as it is commanded thee; the
firstfruits, and the trespass offering, and the gift of the shoulders, and
the sacrifice of sanctification, and the firstfruits of the holy things.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,32);</script>And stretch thine hand
unto the poor, that thy blessing may be perfected.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,33);</script>A gift hath grace in
the sight of every man living; and for the dead detain it not.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,34);</script>Fail not to be with
them that weep, and mourn with them that mourn.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,35);</script>Be not slow to visit
the sick: for that shall make thee to be beloved.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,36);</script>Whatsoever thou takest
in hand, remember the end, and thou shalt never do amiss.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,1);</script>Strive not with a
mighty man’ lest thou fall into his hands.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,2);</script>Be not at variance with
a rich man, lest he overweigh thee: for gold hath destroyed many, and
perverted the hearts of kings.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,3);</script>Strive not with a man
that is full of tongue, and heap not wood upon his fire.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,4);</script>Jest not with a rude
man, lest thy ancestors be disgraced.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script>Reproach not a man that
turneth from sin, but remember that we are all worthy of punishment.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,6);</script>Dishonour not a man in
his old age: for even some of us wax old.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,7);</script>Rejoice not over thy
greatest enemy being dead, but remember that we die all.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,8);</script>Despise not the
discourse of the wise, but acquaint thyself with their proverbs: for of
them thou shalt learn instruction, and how to serve great men with ease.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,9);</script>Miss not the discourse
of the elders: for they also learned of their fathers, and of them thou
shalt learn understanding, and to give answer as need requireth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>Kindle not the coals
of a sinner, lest thou be burnt with the flame of his fire.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,11);</script>Rise not up <I>in
anger</I> at the presence of an injurious person, lest he lie in wait to
entrap thee in thy words
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,12);</script>Lend not unto him that
is mightier than thyself; for if thou lendest him, count it but lost.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,13);</script>Be not surety above
thy power: for if thou be surety, take care to pay it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,14);</script>Go not to law with a
judge; for they will judge for him according to his honour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,15);</script>Travel not by the way
with a bold fellow, lest he become grievous unto thee: for he will do
according to his own will, and thou shalt perish with him through his
folly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,16);</script>Strive not with an
angry man, and go not with him into a solitary place: for blood is as
nothing in his sight, and where there is no help, he will overthrow thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,17);</script>Consult not with a
fool; for he cannot keep counsel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,18);</script>Do no secret thing
before a stranger; for thou knowest not what he will bring forth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,19);</script>Open not thine heart
to every man, lest he requite thee with a shrewd turn.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>Be not jealous over the
wife of thy bosom, and teach her not an evil lesson against thyself.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>Give not thy soul unto
a woman to set her foot upon thy substance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>Meet not with an
harlot, lest thou fall into her snares.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,4);</script>Use not much the
company of a woman that is a singer, lest thou be taken with her attempts.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,5);</script>Gaze not on a maid,
that thou fall not by those things that are precious in her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,6);</script>Give not thy soul unto
harlots, that thou lose not thine inheritance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,7);</script>Look not round about
thee in the streets of the city, neither wander thou in the solitary place
thereof.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,8);</script>Turn away thine eye
from a beautiful woman, and look not upon another’s beauty; for many
have been deceived by the beauty of a woman; for herewith love is kindled
as a fire.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,9);</script>Sit not at all with
another man’s wife, nor sit down with her in thine arms, and spend not
thy money with her at the wine; lest thine heart incline unto her, and so
through thy desire thou fall into destruction.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>Forsake not an old
friend; for the new is not comparable to him: a new friend is as new wine;
when it is old, thou shalt drink it with pleasure.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>Envy not the glory of
a sinner: for thou knowest not what shall be his end.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,12);</script>Delight not in the
thing that the ungodly have pleasure in; but remember they shall not go
unpunished unto their grave.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,13);</script>Keep thee far from the
man that hath power to kill; so shalt thou not doubt the fear of death:
and if thou come unto him, make no fault, lest he take away thy life
presently: remember that thou goest in the midst of snares, and that thou
walkest upon the battlements of the city.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,14);</script>As near as thou canst,
guess at thy neighbour, and consult with the wise.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,15);</script>Let thy talk be with
the wise, and all thy communication in the law of the most High.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,16);</script>And let just men eat
and drink with thee; and let thy glorying be in the fear of the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,17);</script>For the hand of the
artificer the work shall be commended: and the wise ruler of the people
for his speech.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,18);</script>A man of an ill tongue
is dangerous in his city; and he that is rash in his talk shall be hated.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script>A wise judge will
instruct his people; and the government of a prudent man is well ordered.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,2);</script>As the judge of the
people is himself, so are his officers; and what manner of man the ruler
of the city is, such are all they that dwell therein.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,3);</script>An unwise king
destroyeth his people; but through the prudence of them which are in
authority the city shall be inhabited.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,4);</script>The power of the earth
is in the hand of the Lord, and in due time he will set over it one that
is profitable.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,5);</script>In the hand of God is
the prosperity of man: and upon the person of the scribe shall he lay his
honour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,6);</script>Bear not hatred to thy
neighbour for every wrong; and do nothing at all by injurious practices.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,7);</script>Pride is hateful
before God and man: and by both doth one commit iniquity.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,8);</script>Because of unrighteous
dealings, injuries, and riches got by deceit, the kingdom is translated
from one people to another.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,9);</script>Why is earth and ashes
proud? There is not a more wicked thing than a covetous man: for such an
one setteth his own soul to sale; because while he liveth he casteth away
his bowels.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,10);</script>The physician cutteth
off a long disease; and he that is to day a king to morrow shall die.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,11);</script>For when a man is
dead, he shall inherit creeping things, beasts, and worms.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,12);</script>The beginning of
pride is when one departeth from God, and his heart is turned away from
his Maker.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,13);</script>For pride is the
beginning of sin, and he that hath it shall pour out abomination: and
therefore the Lord brought upon them strange calamities, and overthrew
them utterly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,14);</script>The Lord hath cast
down the thrones of proud princes, and set up the meek in their stead.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,15);</script>The Lord hath plucked
up the roots of the proud nations, and planted the lowly in their place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,16);</script>The Lord overthrew
countries of the heathen, and destroyed them to the foundations of the
earth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,17);</script>He took some of them
away, and destroyed them, and hath made their memorial to cease from the
earth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,18);</script>Pride was not made
for men, nor furious anger for them that are born of a woman.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,19);</script>They that fear the
Lord are a sure seed, and they that love him an honourable plant: they
that regard not the law are a dishonourable seed; they that transgress the
commandments are a deceivable seed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,20);</script>Among brethren he
that is chief is honorable; so are they that fear the Lord in his eyes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,21);</script>The fear of the Lord
goeth before the obtaining of authority: but roughness and pride is the
losing thereof.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,22);</script>Whether he be rich,
noble, or poor, their glory is the fear of the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,23);</script>It is not meet to
despise the poor man that hath understanding; neither is it convenient to
magnify a sinful man.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,24);</script>Great men, and
judges, and potentates, shall be honoured; yet is there none of them
greater than he that feareth the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,25);</script>Unto the servant that
is wise shall they that are free do service: and he that hath knowledge
will not grudge when he is reformed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,26);</script>Be not overwise in
doing thy business; and boast not thyself in the time of thy distress.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,27);</script>Better is he that
laboureth, and aboundeth in all things, than he that boasteth himself, and
wanteth bread.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,28);</script>My son, glorify thy
soul in meekness, and give it honour according to the dignity thereof.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,29);</script>Who will justify him
that sinneth against his own soul? and who will honour him that
dishonoureth his own life?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,30);</script>The poor man is
honoured for his skill, and the rich man is honoured for his riches.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,31);</script>He that is honoured
in poverty, how much more in riches? and he that is dishonourable in
riches, how much more in poverty?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>Wisdom lifteth up the
head of him that is of low degree, and maketh him to sit among great men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>Commend not a man for
his beauty; neither abhor a man for his outward appearance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,3);</script>The bee is little
among such as fly; but her fruit is the chief of sweet things.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,4);</script>Boast not of thy
clothing and raiment, and exalt not thyself in the day of honour: for the
works of the Lord are wonderful, and his works among men are hidden.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,5);</script>Many kings have sat
down upon the ground; and one that was never thought of hath worn the
crown.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,6);</script>Many mighty men have
been greatly disgraced; and the honourable delivered into other men’s
hands.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,7);</script>Blame not before thou
hast examined the truth: understand first, and then rebuke.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,8);</script>Answer not before thou
hast heard the cause: neither interrupt men in the midst of their talk.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,9);</script>Strive not in a matter
that concerneth thee not; and sit not in judgment with sinners.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,10);</script>My son, meddle not
with many matters: for if thou meddle much, thou shalt not be innocent;
and if thou follow after, thou shalt not obtain, neither shalt thou escape
by fleeing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,11);</script>There is one that
laboureth, and taketh pains, and maketh haste, and is so much the more
behind.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,12);</script>Again, there is
another that is slow, and hath need of help, wanting ability, and full of
poverty; yet the eye of the Lord looked upon him for good, and set him up
from his low estate,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,13);</script>And lifted up his
head from misery; so that many that saw from him is peace over all the
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,14);</script>Prosperity and
adversity, life and death, poverty and riches, come of the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,15);</script>Wisdom, knowledge,
and understanding of the law, are of the Lord: love, and the way of good
works, are from him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,16);</script>Error and darkness
had their beginning together with sinners: and evil shall wax old with
them that glory therein.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,17);</script>The gift of the Lord
remaineth with the ungodly, and his favour bringeth prosperity for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,18);</script>There is that waxeth
rich by his wariness and pinching, and this his the portion of his reward:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,19);</script>Whereas he saith, I
have found rest, and now will eat continually of my goods; and yet he
knoweth not what time shall come upon him, and that he must leave those
things to others, and die.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,20);</script>Be stedfast in thy
covenant, and be conversant therein, and wax old in thy work.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,21);</script>Marvel not at the
works of sinners; but trust in the Lord, and abide in thy labour: for it
is an easy thing in the sight of the Lord on the sudden to make a poor man
rich.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,22);</script>The blessing of the
Lord is in the reward of the godly, and suddenly he maketh his blessing
flourish.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,23);</script>Say not, What profit
is there of my service? and what good things shall I have hereafter?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,24);</script>Again, say not, I
have enough, and possess many things, and what evil shall I have hereafter?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,25);</script>In the day of
prosperity there is a forgetfulness of affliction: and in the day of
affliction there is no more remembrance of prosperity.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,26);</script>For it is an easy
thing unto the Lord in the day of death to reward a man according to his
ways.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,27);</script>The affliction of an
hour maketh a man forget pleasure: and in his end his deeds shall be
discovered.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,28);</script>Judge none blessed
before his death: for a man shall be known in his children.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,29);</script>Bring not every man
into thine house: for the deceitful man hath many trains.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,30);</script>Like as a partridge
taken <I>and kept</I> in a cage, so is the heart of the proud; and like as
a spy, watcheth he for thy fall:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,31);</script>For he lieth in wait,
and turneth good into evil, and in things worthy praise will lay blame
upon thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,32);</script>Of a spark of fire a
heap of coals is kindled: and a sinful man layeth wait for blood.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,33);</script>Take heed of a
mischievous man, for he worketh wickedness; lest he bring upon thee a
perpetual blot.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,34);</script>Receive a stranger
into thine house, and he will disturb thee, and turn thee out of thine own.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>When thou wilt do good
know to whom thou doest it; so shalt thou be thanked for thy benefits.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,2);</script>Do good to the godly
man, and thou shalt find a recompence; and if not from him, yet from the
most High.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,3);</script>There can no good come
to him that is always occupied in evil, nor to him that giveth no alms.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,4);</script>Give to the godly man,
and help not a sinner.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,5);</script>Do well unto him that
is lowly, but give not to the ungodly: hold back thy bread, and give it
not unto him, lest he overmaster thee thereby: for <I>else</I> thou shalt
receive twice as much evil for all the good thou shalt have done unto him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,6);</script>For the most High
hateth sinners, and will repay vengeance unto the ungodly, and keepeth
them against the mighty day of their punishment.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,7);</script>Give unto the good,
and help not the sinner.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,8);</script>A friend cannot be
known in prosperity: and an enemy cannot be hidden in adversity.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,9);</script>In the prosperity of a
man enemies will be grieved: but in his adversity even a friend will
depart.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,10);</script>Never trust thine
enemy: for like as iron rusteth, so is his wickedness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,11);</script>Though he humble
himself, and go crouching, yet take good heed and beware of him, and thou
shalt be unto him as if thou hadst wiped a lookingglass, and thou shalt
know that his rust hath not been altogether wiped away.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,12);</script>Set him not by thee,
lest, when he hath overthrown thee, he stand up in thy place; neither let
him sit at thy right hand, lest he seek to take thy seat, and thou at the
last remember my words, and be pricked therewith.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,13);</script>Who will pity a
charmer that is bitten with a serpent, or any such as come nigh wild
beasts?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,14);</script>So one that goeth to
a sinner, and is defiled with him in his sins, who will pity?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,15);</script>For a while he will
abide with thee, but if thou begin to fall, he will not tarry.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,16);</script>An enemy speaketh
sweetly with his lips, but in his heart he imagineth how to throw thee
into a pit: he will weep with his eyes, but if he find opportunity, he
will not be satisfied with blood.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,17);</script>If adversity come
upon thee, thou shalt find him there first; and though he pretend to help
thee, yet shall he undermine thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,18);</script>He will shake his
head, and clap his hands, and whisper much, and change his countenance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,1);</script>He that toucheth pitch
shall be defiled therewith; and he that hath fellowship with a proud man
shall be like unto him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,2);</script>Burden not thyself
above thy power while thou livest; and have no fellowship with one that is
mightier and richer than thyself: for how agree the kettle and the earthen
pot together? for if the one be smitten against the other, it shall be
broken.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,3);</script>The rich man hath done
wrong, and yet he threateneth withal: the poor is wronged, and he must
intreat also.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,4);</script>If thou be for his
profit, he will use thee: but if thou have nothing, he will forsake thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,5);</script>If thou have any
thing, he will live with thee: yea, he will make thee bare, and will not
be sorry for it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,6);</script>If he have need of
thee, he will deceive thee, and smile upon thee, and put thee in hope; he
will speak thee fair, and say, What wantest thou?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,7);</script>And he will shame thee
by his meats, until he have drawn thee dry twice or thrice, and at the
last he will laugh thee to scorn afterward, when he seeth thee, he will
forsake thee, and shake his head at thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,8);</script>Beware that thou be
not deceived and brought down in thy jollity.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,9);</script>If thou be invited of
a mighty man, withdraw thyself, and so much the more will he invite thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,10);</script>Press thou not upon
him, lest thou be put back; stand not far off, lest thou be forgotten.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,11);</script>Affect not to be made
equal unto him in talk, and believe not his many words: for with much
communication will he tempt thee, and smiling upon thee will get out thy
secrets:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,12);</script>But cruelly he will
lay up thy words, and will not spare to do thee hurt, and to put thee in
prison.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,13);</script>Observe, and take
good heed, for thou walkest in peril of thy overthrowing: when thou
hearest these things, awake in thy sleep.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,14);</script>Love the Lord all thy
life, and call upon him for thy salvation.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,15);</script>Every beast loveth
his like, and every man loveth his neighbor.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,16);</script>All flesh consorteth
according to kind, and a man will cleave to his like.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,17);</script>What fellowship hath
the wolf with the lamb? so the sinner with the godly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,18);</script>What agreement is
there between the hyena and a dog? and what peace between the rich and the
poor?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,19);</script>As the wild ass is
the lion’s prey in the wilderness: so the rich eat up the poor.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,20);</script>As the proud hate
humility: so doth the rich abhor the poor.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,21);</script>A rich man beginning
to fall is held up of his friends: but a poor man being down is thrust
away by his friends.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,22);</script>When a rich man is
fallen, he hath many helpers: he speaketh things not to be spoken, and yet
men justify him: the poor man slipped, and yet they rebuked him too; he
spake wisely, and could have no place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,23);</script>When a rich man
speaketh, every man holdeth his tongue, and, look, what he saith, they
extol it to the clouds: but if the poor man speak, they say, What fellow
is this? and if he stumble, they will help to overthrow him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,24);</script>Riches are good unto
him that hath no sin, and poverty is evil in the mouth of the ungodly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,25);</script>The heart of a man
changeth his countenance, whether it be for good or evil: and a merry
heart maketh a cheerful countenance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,26);</script>A cheerful
countenance is a token of a heart that is in prosperity; and the finding
out of parables is a wearisome labour of the mind.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,1);</script>Blessed is the man
that hath not slipped with his mouth, and is not pricked with the
multitude of sins.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,2);</script>Blessed is he whose
conscience hath not condemned him, and who is not fallen from his hope in
the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,3);</script>Riches are not comely
for a niggard: and what should an envious man do with money?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,4);</script>He that gathereth by
defrauding his own soul gathereth for others, that shall spend his goods
riotously.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>He that is evil to
himself, to whom will he be good? he shall not take pleasure in his goods.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>There is none worse
than he that envieth himself; and this is a recompence of his wickedness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,7);</script>And if he doeth good,
he doeth it unwillingly; and at the last he will declare his wickedness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,8);</script>The envious man hath a
wicked eye; he turneth away his face, and despiseth men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,9);</script>A covetous man’s eye
is not satisfied with his portion; and the iniquity of the wicked drieth
up his soul.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,10);</script>A wicked eye envieth
<I>his</I> bread, and he is a niggard at his table.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,11);</script>My son, according to
thy ability do good to thyself, and give the Lord his due offering.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,12);</script>Remember that death
will not be long in coming, and that the covenant of the grave is not
shewed unto thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,13);</script>Do good unto thy
friend before thou die, and according to thy ability stretch out thy hand
and give to him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,14);</script>Defraud not thyself
of the good day, and let not the part of a good desire overpass thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,15);</script>Shalt thou not leave
thy travails unto another? and thy labours to be divided by lot?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,16);</script>Give, and take, and
sanctify thy soul; for there is no seeking of dainties in the grave.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,17);</script>All flesh waxeth old
as a garment: for the covenant from the beginning is, Thou shalt die the
death.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,18);</script>As of the green
leaves on a thick tree, some fall, and some grow; so is the generation of
flesh and blood, one cometh to an end, and another is born.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,19);</script>Every work rotteth
and consumeth away, and the worker thereof shall go withal.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,20);</script>Blessed is the man
that doth meditate good things in wisdom, and that reasoneth of holy
things by his understanding. ing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,21);</script>He that considereth
her ways in his heart shall also have understanding in her secrets.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,22);</script>Go after her as one
that traceth, and lie in wait in her ways.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,23);</script>He that prieth in at
her windows shall also hearken at her doors.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,24);</script>He that doth lodge
near her house shall also fasten a pin in her walls.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,25);</script>He shall pitch his
tent nigh unto her, and shall lodge in a lodging where good things are.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,26);</script>He shall set his
children under her shelter, and shall lodge under her branches.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,27);</script>By her he shall be
covered from heat, and in her glory shall he dwell.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,1);</script>He that feareth the
Lord will do good, and he that hath the knowledge of the law shall obtain
her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,2);</script>And as a mother shall
she meet him, and receive him as a wife married of a virgin.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,3);</script>With the bread of
understanding shall she feed him, and give him the water of wisdom to
drink.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,4);</script>He shall be stayed
upon her, and shall not be moved; and shall rely upon her, and shall not
be confounded.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,5);</script>She shall exalt him
above his neighbours, and in the midst of the congregation shall she open
his mouth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,6);</script>He shall find joy and
a crown of gladness, and she shall cause him to inherit an everlasting
name.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,7);</script>But foolish men shall
not attain unto her, and sinners shall not see her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,8);</script>For she is far from
pride, and men that are liars cannot remember her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,9);</script>Praise is not seemly
in the mouth of a sinner, for it was not sent him of the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,10);</script>For praise shall be
uttered in wisdom, and the Lord will prosper it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,11);</script>Say not thou, It is
through the Lord that I fell away: for thou oughtest not to do the things
that he hateth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,12);</script>Say not thou, He hath
caused me to err: for he hath no need of the sinful man.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,13);</script>The Lord hateth all
abomination; and they that fear God love it not.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,14);</script>He himself made man
from the beginning, and left him in the hand of his counsel;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,15);</script>If thou wilt, to keep
the commandments, and to perform acceptable faithfulness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,16);</script>He hath set fire and
water before thee: stretch forth thy hand unto whether thou wilt.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,17);</script>Before man is life
and death; and whether him liketh shall be given him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,18);</script>For the wisdom of the
Lord is great, and he is mighty in power, and beholdeth all things:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,19);</script>And his eyes are upon
them that fear him, and he knoweth every work of man.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,20);</script>He hath commanded no
man to do wickedly, neither hath he given any man licence to sin.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,1);</script>Desire not a multitude
of unprofitable children, neither delight in ungodly sons.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,2);</script>Though they multiply,
rejoice not in them, except the fear of the Lord be with them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,3);</script>Trust not thou in
their life, neither respect their multitude: for one that is just is
better than a thousand; and better it is to die without children, than to
have them that are ungodly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,4);</script>For by one that hath
understanding shall the city be replenished: but the kindred of the wicked
shall speedily become desolate.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,5);</script>Many such things have
I seen with mine eyes, and mine ear hath heard greater things than these.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,6);</script>In the congregation of
the ungodly shall a fire be kindled; and in a rebellious nation wrath is
set on fire.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,7);</script>He was not pacified
toward the old giants, who fell away in the strength of their foolishness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,8);</script>Neither spared he the
place where Lot sojourned, but abhorred them for their pride.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,9);</script>He pitied not the
people of perdition, who were taken away in their sins:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,10);</script>Nor the six hundred
thousand footmen, who were gathered together in the hardness of their
hearts.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,11);</script>And if there be one
stiffnecked among the people, it is marvel if he escape unpunished: for
mercy and wrath are with him; he is mighty to forgive, and to pour out
displeasure.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,12);</script>As his mercy is
great, so is his correction also: he judgeth a man according to his works
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,13);</script>The sinner shall not
escape with his spoils: and the patience of the godly shall not be
frustrate.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,14);</script>Make way for every
work of mercy: for every man shall find according to his works.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,15);</script>The Lord hardened
Pharaoh, that he should not know him, that his powerful works might be
known to the world.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,16);</script>His mercy is manifest
to every creature; and he hath separated his light from the darkness with
an adamant.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,17);</script>Say not thou, I will
hide myself from the Lord: shall any remember me from above? I shall not
be remembered among so many people: for what is my soul among such an
infinite number of creatures?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,18);</script>Behold, the heaven,
and the heaven of heavens, the deep, and the earth, and all that therein
is, shall be moved when he shall visit.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,19);</script>The mountains also
and foundations of the earth be shaken with trembling, when the Lord
looketh upon them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,20);</script>No heart can think
upon these things worthily: and who is able to conceive his ways?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,21);</script>It is a tempest which
no man can see: for the most part of his works are hid.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,22);</script>Who can declare the
works of his justice? or who can endure them? for his covenant is afar
off, and the trial of all things is in the end.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,23);</script>He that wanteth
understanding will think upon vain things: and a foolish man erring
imagineth follies.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,24);</script>by son, hearken unto
me, and learn knowledge, and mark my words with thy heart.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,25);</script>I will shew forth
doctrine in weight, and declare his knowledge exactly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,26);</script>The works of the Lord
are done in judgment from the beginning: and from the time he made them he
disposed the parts thereof.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,27);</script>He garnished his
works for ever, and in his hand are the chief of them unto all
generations: they neither labour, nor are weary, nor cease from their
works.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,28);</script>None of them
hindereth another, and they shall never disobey his word.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,29);</script>After this the Lord
looked upon the earth, and filled it with his blessings.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,30);</script>With all manner of
living things hath he covered the face thereof; and they shall return into
it again.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,1);</script>The Lord created man
of the earth, and turned him into it again.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,2);</script>He gave them few days,
and a short time, and power also over the things therein.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,3);</script>He endued them with
strength by themselves, and made them according to his image,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,4);</script>And put the fear of
man upon all flesh, and gave him dominion over beasts and fowls.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,5);</script>They received the use
of the five operations of the Lord, and in the sixth place he imparted
them understanding, and in the seventh speech, an interpreter of the
cogitations thereof.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,6);</script>Counsel, and a tongue,
and eyes, ears, and a heart, gave he them to understand.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,7);</script>Withal he filled them
with the knowledge of understanding, and shewed them good and evil.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,8);</script>He set his eye upon
their hearts, that he might shew them the greatness of his works.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,9);</script>He gave them to glory
in his marvellous acts for ever, that they might declare his works with
understanding.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,10);</script>And the elect shall
praise his holy name.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,11);</script>Beside this he gave
them knowledge, and the law of life for an heritage.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,12);</script>He made an
everlasting covenant with them, and shewed them his judgments.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,13);</script>Their eyes saw the
majesty of his glory, and their ears heard his glorious voice.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,14);</script>And he said unto
them, Beware of all unrighteousness; and he gave every man commandment
concerning his neighbour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,15);</script>Their ways are ever
before him, and shall not be hid from his eyes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,16);</script>Every man from his
youth is given to evil; neither could they make to themselves fleshy
hearts for stony.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,17);</script>For in the division
of the nations of the whole earth he set a ruler over every people; but
Israel is the Lord’s portion:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,18);</script>Whom, being his
firstborn, he nourisheth with discipline, and giving him the light of his
love doth not forsake him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,19);</script>Therefore all their
works are as the sun before him, and his eyes are continually upon their
ways.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,20);</script>None of their
unrighteous deeds are hid from him, but all their sins are before the Lord
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,21);</script>But the Lord being
gracious and knowing his workmanship, neither left nor forsook them, but
spared them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,22);</script>The alms of a man is
as a signet with him, and he will keep the good deeds of man as the apple
of the eye, and give repentance to his sons and daughters.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,23);</script>Afterwards he will
rise up and reward them, and render their recompence upon their heads.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,24);</script>But unto them that
repent, he granted them return, and comforted those that failed in
patience.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,25);</script>Return unto the Lord,
and forsake thy sins, make thy prayer before his face, and offend less.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,26);</script>Turn again to the
most High, and turn away from iniquity: for he will lead thee out of
darkness into the light of health, and hate thou abomination vehemently.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,27);</script>Who shall praise the
most High in the grave, instead of them which live and give thanks?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,28);</script>Thanksgiving
perisheth from the dead, as from one that is not: the living and sound in
heart shall praise the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,29);</script>How great is the
lovingkindness of the Lord our God, and his compassion unto such as turn
unto him in holiness!
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,30);</script>For all things cannot
be in men, because the son of man is not immortal.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,31);</script>What is brighter than
the sun? yet the light thereof faileth; and flesh and blood will imagine
evil.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,32);</script>He vieweth the power
of the height of heaven; and all men are but earth and ashes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,1);</script>He that liveth for
ever Hath created all things in general.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,2);</script>The Lord only is
righteous, and there is none other but he,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,3);</script>Who governeth the
world with the palm of his hand, and all things obey his will: for he is
the King of all, by his power dividing holy things among them from profane.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,4);</script>To whom hath he given
power to declare his works? and who shall find out his noble acts?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,5);</script>Who shall number the
strength of his majesty? and who shall also tell out his mercies?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,6);</script>As for the wondrous
works of the Lord, there may nothing be taken from them, neither may any
thing be put unto them, neither can the ground of them be found out.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,7);</script>When a man hath done,
then he beginneth; and when he leaveth off, then he shall be doubtful.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,8);</script>What is man, and
whereto serveth he? what is his good, and what is his evil?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,9);</script>The number of a
man’s days at the most are an hundred years.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,10);</script>As a drop of water
unto the sea, and a gravelstone in comparison of the sand; so are a
thousand years to the days of eternity.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,11);</script>Therefore is God
patient with them, and poureth forth his mercy upon them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,12);</script>He saw and perceived
their end to be evil; therefore he multiplied his compassion.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,13);</script>The mercy of man is
toward his neighbour; but the mercy of the Lord is upon all flesh: he
reproveth, and nurtureth, and teacheth and bringeth again, as a shepherd
his flock.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,14);</script>He hath mercy on them
that receive discipline, and that diligently seek after his judgments.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,15);</script>My son, blemish not
thy good deeds, neither use uncomfortable words when thou givest any thing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,16);</script>Shall not the dew
asswage the heat? so is a word better than a gift.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,17);</script>Lo, is not a word
better than a gift? but both are with a gracious man.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,18);</script>A fool will upbraid
churlishly, and a gift of the envious consumeth the eyes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,19);</script>Learn before thou
speak, and use physick or ever thou be sick.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,20);</script>Before judgment
examine thyself, and in the day of visitation thou shalt find mercy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,21);</script>Humble thyself before
thou be sick, and in the time of sins shew repentance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,22);</script>Let nothing hinder
thee to pay thy vow in due time, and defer not until death to be justified.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,23);</script>Before thou prayest,
prepare thyself; and be not as one that tempteth the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,24);</script>Think upon the wrath
that shall be at the end, and the time of vengeance, when he shall turn
away his face.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,25);</script>When thou hast
enough, remember the time of hunger: and when thou art rich, think upon
poverty and need.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,26);</script>From the morning
until the evening the time is changed, and all things are soon done before
the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,27);</script>A wise man will fear
in every thing, and in the day of sinning he will beware of offence: but a
fool will not observe time.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,28);</script>Every man of
understanding knoweth wisdom, and will give praise unto him that found her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,29);</script>They that were of
understanding in sayings became also wise themselves, and poured forth
exquisite parables.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,30);</script>Go not after thy
lusts, but refrain thyself from thine appetites.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,31);</script>If thou givest thy
soul the desires that please her, she will make thee a laughingstock to
thine enemies that malign thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,32);</script>Take not pleasure in
much good cheer, neither be tied to the expence thereof.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,33);</script>Be not made a beggar
by banqueting upon borrowing, when thou hast nothing in thy purse: for
thou shalt lie in wait for thine own life, and be talked on.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,1);</script>A labouring man that A
is given to drunkenness shall not be rich: and he that contemneth small
things shall fall by little and little.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,2);</script>Wine and women will
make men of understanding to fall away: and he that cleaveth to harlots
will become impudent.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,3);</script>Moths and worms shall
have him to heritage, and a bold man shall be taken away.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,4);</script>He that is hasty to
give credit is lightminded; and he that sinneth shall offend against his
own soul.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,5);</script>Whoso taketh pleasure
in wickedness shall be condemned: but he that resisteth pleasures crowneth
his life.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,6);</script>He that can rule his

less evil.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,7);</script>Rehearse not unto

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,8);</script>Whether it be to
friend or foe, talk not of other men’s lives; and if thou canst without
offence, reveal them not.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,9);</script>For he heard and
observed thee, and when time cometh he will hate thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,10);</script>If thou hast heard a
word, let it die with thee; and be bold, it will not burst thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,11);</script>A fool travaileth
with a word, as a woman in labour of a child.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,12);</script>As an arrow that
sticketh in a man’s thigh, so is a word within a fool’s belly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,13);</script>Admonish a friend, it
may be he hath not done it: and if he have done it, that he do it no more.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,14);</script>Admonish thy friend,
it may be he hath not said it: and if he have, that he speak it not again.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,15);</script>Admonish a friend:
for many times it is a slander, and believe not every tale.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,16);</script>There is one that
slippeth in his speech, but not from his heart; and who is he that hath
not offended with his tongue?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,17);</script>Admonish thy
neighbour before thou threaten him; and not being angry, give place to the
law of the most High.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,18);</script>The fear of the Lord
is the first step to be accepted <I>of him,</I> and wisdom obtaineth his
love.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,19);</script>The knowledge of the
commandments of the Lord is the doctrine of life: and they that do things
that please him shall receive the fruit of the tree of immortality.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,20);</script>The fear of the Lord
is all wisdom; and in all wisdom is the performance of the law, and the
knowledge of his omnipotency.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,21);</script>If a servant say to
his master, I will not do as it pleaseth thee; though afterward he do it,
he angereth him that nourisheth him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,22);</script>The knowledge of
wickedness is not wisdom, neither at any time the counsel of sinners
prudence.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,23);</script>There is a
wickedness, and the same an abomination; and there is a fool wanting in
wisdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,24);</script>He that hath small
understanding, and feareth God, is better than one that hath much wisdom,
and transgresseth the law of the most High.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,25);</script>There is an exquisite
subtilty, and the same is unjust; and there is one that turneth aside to
make judgment appear; and there is a wise man that justifieth in judgment.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,26);</script>There is a wicked man
that hangeth down his head sadly; but inwardly he is full of deceit,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,27);</script>Casting down his
countenance, and making as if he heard not: where he is not known, he will
do thee a mischief before thou be aware.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,28);</script>And if for want of
power he be hindered from sinning, yet when he findeth opportunity he will
do evil.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,29);</script>A man may be known by
his look, and one that hath understanding by his countenance, when thou
meetest him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,30);</script>A man’s attire, and
excessive laughter, and gait, shew what he is.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,1);</script>There is a reproof
that is not comely: again, some man holdeth his tongue, and he is wise.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,2);</script>It is much better to
reprove, than to be angry secretly: and he that confesseth his fault shall
be preserved from hurt.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,3);</script>How good is it, when
thou art reproved, to shew repentance! for so shalt thou escape wilful sin.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,4);</script>As is the lust of an
eunuch to deflower a virgin; so is he that executeth judgment with
violence.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,5);</script>There is one that
keepeth silence, and is found wise: and another by much babbling becometh
hateful.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,6);</script>Some man holdeth his
tongue, because he hath not to answer: and some keepeth silence, knowing
his time.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,7);</script>A wise man will hold
his tongue till he see opportunity: but a babbler and a fool will regard
no time.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,8);</script>He that useth many
words shall be abhorred; and he that taketh to himself authority therein
shall be hated.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,9);</script>There is a sinner that
hath good success in evil things; and t,1);</script>The Lord created man
of the earth, and turned him into it again.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,2);</script>He gave them few days,
and a short time, and power also over the things therein.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,3);</script>He endued them with
strength by themselves, and made them according to his image,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,4);</script>And put the fear of
man upon all flesh, and gave him dominion over beasts and fowls.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,5);</script>They received the use
of the five operations of the Lord, and in the sixth place he imparted
them understanding, and in the seventh speech, an interpreter of the
cogitations thereof.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,6);</script>Counsel, and a tongue,
and eyes, ears, and a heart, gave he them to understand.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,7);</script>Withal he filled them
with the knowledge of understanding, and shewed them good and evil.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,8);</script>He set his eye upon
their hearts, that he might shew them the greatness of his works.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,9);</script>He gave them to glory
in his marvellous acts for ever, that they might declare his works with
understanding.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,10);</script>And the elect shall
praise his holy name.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,11);</script>Beside this he gave
them knowledge, and the law of life for an heritage.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,12);</script>He made an
everlasting covenant with them, and shewed them his judgments.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,13);</script>Their eyes saw the
majesty of his glory, and their ears heard his glorious voice.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,14);</script>And he said unto
them, Beware of all unrighteousness; and he gave every man commandment
concerning his neighbour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,15);</script>Their ways are ever
before him, and shall not be hid from his eyes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,16);</script>Every man from his
youth is given to evil; neither could they make to themselves fleshy
hearts for stony.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,17);</script>For in the division
of the nations of the whole earth he set a ruler over every people; but
Israel is the Lord’s portion:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,18);</script>Whom, being his
firstborn, he nourisheth with discipline, and giving him the light of his
love doth not forsake him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,19);</script>Therefore all their
works are as the sun before him, and his eyes are continually upon their
ways.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,20);</script>None of their
unrighteous deeds are hid from him, but all their sins are before the Lord
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,21);</script>But the Lord being
gracious and knowing his workmanship, neither left nor forsook them, but
spared them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,22);</script>The alms of a man is
as a signet with him, and he will keep the good deeds of man as the apple
of the eye, and give repentance to his sons and daughters.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,23);</script>Afterwards he will
rise up and reward them, and render their recompence upon their heads.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,24);</script>But unto them that
repent, he granted them return, and comforted those that failed in
patience.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,25);</script>Return unto the Lord,
and forsake thy sins, make thy prayer before his face, and offend less.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,26);</script>Turn again to the
most High, and turn away from iniquity: for he will lead thee out of
darkness into the light of health, and hate thou abomination vehemently.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,27);</script>Who shall praise the
most High in the grave, instead of them which live and give thanks?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,28);</script>Thanksgiving
perisheth from the dead, as from one that is not: the living and sound in
heart shall praise the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,29);</script>How great is the
lovingkindness of the Lord our God, and his compassion unto such as turn
unto him in holiness!
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,30);</script>For all things cannot
be in men, because the son of man is not immortal.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,31);</script>What is brighter than
the sun? yet the light thereof faileth; and flesh and blood will imagine
evil.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,32);</script>He vieweth the power
of the height of heaven; and all men are but earth and ashes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,1);</script>He that liveth for
ever Hath created all things in general.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,2);</script>The Lord only is
righteous, and there is none other but he,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,3);</script>Who governeth the
world with the palm of his hand, and all things obey his will: for he is
the King of all, by his power dividing holy things among them from profane.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,4);</script>To whom hath he given
power to declare his works? and who shall find out his noble acts?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,5);</script>Who shall number the
strength of his majesty? and who shall also tell out his mercies?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,6);</script>As for the wondrous
works of the Lord, there may nothing be taken from them, neither may any
thing be put unto them, neither can the ground of them be found out.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,7);</script>When a man hath done,
then he beginneth; and when he leaveth off, then he shall be doubtful.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,8);</script>What is man, and
whereto serveth he? what is his good, and what is his evil?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,9);</script>The number of a
man’s days at the most are an hundred years.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,10);</script>As a drop of water
unto the sea, and a gravelstone in comparison of the sand; so are a
thousand years to the days of eternity.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,11);</script>Therefore is God
patient with them, and poureth forth his mercy upon them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,12);</script>He saw and perceived
their end to be evil; therefore he multiplied his compassion.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,13);</script>The mercy of man is
toward his neighbour; but the mercy of the Lord is upon all flesh: he
reproveth, and nurtureth, and teacheth and bringeth again, as a shepherd
his flock.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,14);</script>He hath mercy on them
that receive discipline, and that diligently seek after his judgments.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,15);</script>My son, blemish not
thy good deeds, neither use uncomfortable words when thou givest any thing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,16);</script>Shall not the dew
asswage the heat? so is a word better than a gift.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,17);</script>Lo, is not a word
better than a gift? but both are with a gracious man.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,18);</script>A fool will upbraid
churlishly, and a gift of the envious consumeth the eyes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,19);</script>Learn before thou
speak, and use physick or ever thou be sick.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,20);</script>Before judgment
examine thyself, and in the day of visitation thou shalt find mercy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,21);</script>Humble thyself before
thou be sick, and in the time of sins shew repentance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,22);</script>Let nothing hinder
thee to pay thy vow in due time, and defer not until death to be justified.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,23);</script>Before thou prayest,
prepare thyself; and be not as one that tempteth the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,24);</script>Think upon the wrath
that shall be at the end, and the time of vengeance, when he shall turn
away his face.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,25);</script>When thou hast
enough, remember the time of hunger: and when thou art rich, think upon
poverty and need.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,26);</script>From the morning
until the evening the time is changed, and all things are soon done before
the Lord.

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,15);</script>He giveth little, and
upbraideth much; he openeth his mouth like a crier; to day he lendeth, and
to morrow will he ask it again: such an one is to be hated of God and man.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,16);</script>The fool saith, I
have no friends, I have no thank for all my good deeds, and they that eat
my bread speak evil of me.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,17);</script>How oft, and of how
many shall he be laughed to scorn! for he knoweth not aright what it is to
have; and it is all one unto him as if he had it not.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,18);</script>To slip upon a
pavement is better than to slip with the tongue: so the fall of the wicked
shall come speedily.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,19);</script>An unseasonable tale
will always be in the mouth of the unwise.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,20);</script>A wise sentence shall
be rejected when it cometh out of a fool’s mouth; for he will not speak
it in due season.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,21);</script>There is that is
hindered from sinning through want: and when he taketh rest, he shall not
be troubled.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,22);</script>There is that
destroyeth his own soul through bashfulness, and by accepting of persons
overthroweth himself.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,23);</script>There is that for
bashfulness promiseth to his friend, and maketh him his enemy for nothing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,24);</script>A lie is a foul blot
in a man, yet it is continually in the mouth of the untaught.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,25);</script>A thief is better
than a man that is accustomed to lie: but they both shall have destruction
to heritage.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,26);</script>The disposition of a
liar is dishonourable, and his shame is ever with him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,27);</script>A wise man shall
promote himself to honour with his words: and he that hath understanding
will please great men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,28);</script>He that tilleth his
land shall increase his heap: and he that pleaseth great men shall get
pardon for iniquity.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,29);</script>Presents and gifts
blind the eyes of the wise, and stop up his mouth that he cannot reprove.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,30);</script>Wisdom that is hid,
and treasure that is hoarded up, what profit is in them both?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,31);</script>Better is he that
hideth his folly than a man that hideth his wisdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,32);</script>Necessary patience in
seeking ing the Lord is better than he that leadeth his life without a
guide.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,1);</script>My son, hast thou
sinned? do so no more, but ask pardon for thy former sins.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,2);</script>Flee from sin as from
the face of a serpent: for if thou comest too near it, it will bite thee:
the teeth thereof are as the teeth of a lion, slaying the souls of men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,3);</script>All iniquity is as a
two edged sword, the wounds whereof cannot be healed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,4);</script>To terrify and do
wrong will waste riches: thus the house of proud men shall be made
desolate.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,5);</script>A prayer out of a poor
man’s mouth reacheth to the ears of God, and his judgment cometh
speedily.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,6);</script>He that hateth to be
reproved is in the way of sinners: but he that feareth the Lord will
repent from his heart.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,7);</script>An eloquent man is
known far and near; but a man of understanding knoweth when he slippeth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,8);</script>He that buildeth his
house with other men’s money is like one that gathereth himself stones
for the tomb of his burial.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,9);</script>The congregation of
the wicked is like tow wrapped together: and the end of them is a flame of
fire to destroy them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,10);</script>The way of sinners is
made plain with stones, but at the end thereof is the pit of hell.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,11);</script>He that keepeth the
law of the Lord getteth the understanding thereof: and the perfection of
the fear of the Lord is wisdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,12);</script>He that is not wise
will not be taught: but there is a wisdom which multiplieth bitterness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,13);</script>The knowledge of a
wise man shall abound like a flood: and his counsel is like a pure
fountain of life.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,14);</script>The inner parts of a
fool are like a broken vessel, and he will hold no knowledge as long as he
liveth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,15);</script>If a skilful man hear
a wise word, he will commend it, and add unto it: but as soon as one of no
understanding heareth it, it displeaseth him, and he casteth it behind his
back.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,16);</script>The talking of a fool
is like a burden in the way: but grace shall be found in the lips of the
wise.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,17);</script>They enquire at the
mouth of the wise man in the congregation, and they shall ponder his words
in their heart.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,18);</script>As is a house that is
destroyed, so is wisdom to a fool: and the knowledge of the unwise is as
talk without sense.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,19);</script>Doctrine unto fools
is as fetters on the feet, and like manacles on the right hand.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,20);</script>A fool lifteth up his
voice with laughter; but a wise man doth scarce smile a little.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,21);</script>Learning is unto a
wise man as an ornament of gold, and like a bracelet upon his right arm.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,22);</script>A foolish man’s
foot is soon in his <I>neighbour’s</I> house: but a man of experience is
ashamed of him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,23);</script>A fool will peep in
at the door into the house: but he that is well nurtured will stand
without.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,24);</script>It is the rudeness of
a man to hearken at the door: but a wise man will be grieved with the
disgrace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,25);</script>The lips of talkers
will be telling such things as pertain not unto them: but the words of
such as have understanding are weighed in the balance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,26);</script>The heart of fools is
in their mouth: but the mouth of the wise is in their heart.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,27);</script>When the ungodly
curseth Satan, he curseth his own soul.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,28);</script>A whisperer defileth
his own soul, and is hated wheresoever he dwelleth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,1);</script>A slothful man is
compared to a filthy stone, and every one will hiss him out to his
disgrace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,2);</script>A slothful man is
compared to the filth of a dunghill: every man that takes it up will shake
his hand.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,3);</script>An evilnurtured man is
the dishonour of his father that begat him: and a <I>foolish</I> daughter
is born to his loss.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,4);</script>A wise daughter shall
bring an inheritance to her husband: but she that liveth dishonestly is
her father’s heaviness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,5);</script>She that is bold
dishonoureth both her father and her husband, but they both shall despise
her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,6);</script>A tale out of season
<I>is as</I> musick in mourning: but stripes and correction of wisdom are
never out of time.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,7);</script>Whoso teacheth a fool
is as one that glueth a potsherd together, and as he that waketh one from
a sound sleep.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,8);</script>He that telleth a tale
to a fool speaketh to one in a slumber: when he hath told his tale, he
will say, What is the matter?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,9);</script>If children live
honestly, and have wherewithal, they shall cover the baseness of their
parents.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,10);</script>But children, being
haughty, through disdain and want of nurture do stain the nobility of
their kindred.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,11);</script>Weep for the dead,
for he hath lost the light: and weep for the fool, for he wanteth
understanding: make little weeping for the dead, for he is at rest: but
the life of the fool is worse than death.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,12);</script>Seven days do men
mourn for him that is dead; but for a fool and an ungodly man all the days
of his life.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,13);</script>Talk not much with a
fool, and go not to him that hath no understanding: beware of him, lest
thou have trouble, and thou shalt never be defiled with his fooleries:
depart from him, and thou shalt find rest, and never be disquieted with
madness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,14);</script>What is heavier than
lead? and what is the name thereof, but a fool?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,15);</script>Sand, and salt, and a
mass of iron, is easier to bear, than a man without understanding.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,16);</script>As timber girt and
bound together in a building cannot be loosed with shaking: so the heart
that is stablished by advised counsel shall fear at no time.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,17);</script>A heart settled upon
a thought of understanding is as a fair plaistering on the wall of a
gallery.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,18);</script>Pales set on an high
place will never stand against the wind: so a fearful heart in the
imagination of a fool cannot stand against any fear.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,19);</script>He that pricketh the
eye will make tears to fall: and he that pricketh the heart maketh it to
shew her knowledge.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,20);</script>Whoso casteth a stone
at the birds frayeth them away: and he that upbraideth his friend breaketh
friendship.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,21);</script>Though thou drewest a
sword at thy friend, yet despair not: for there may be a returning <I>to
favour.</I>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,22);</script>If thou hast opened
thy mouth against thy friend, fear not; for there may be a reconciliation:
except for upbraiding, or pride, or disclosing of secrets, or a
treacherous wound: for for these things every friend will depart.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,23);</script>Be faithful to thy
neighbour in his poverty, that thou mayest rejoice in his prosperity:
abide stedfast unto him in the time of his trouble, that thou mayest be
heir with him in his heritage: for a mean estate is not always to be
contemned: nor the rich that is foolish to be had in admiration.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,24);</script>As the vapour and
smoke of a furnace goeth before the fire; so reviling before blood.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,25);</script>I will not be ashamed
to defend a friend; neither will I hide myself from him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,26);</script>And if any evil
happen unto me by him, every one that heareth it will beware of him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,27);</script>Who shall set a watch
before my mouth, and a seal of wisdom upon my lips, that I fall not
suddenly by them, and that my tongue destroy me not?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,1);</script>O Lord, Father and
Governor of all my whole life, leave me not to their counsels, and let me
not fall by them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,2);</script>Who will set scourges
over my thoughts, and the discipline of wisdom over mine heart? that they
spare me not for mine ignorances, and it pass not by my sins:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,3);</script>Lest mine ignorances
increase, and my sins abound to my destruction, and I fall before mine
adversaries, and mine enemy rejoice over me, whose hope is far from thy
mercy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,4);</script>O Lord, Father and God
of my life, give me not a proud look, but turn away from thy servants
always a haughty mind.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,5);</script>Turn away from me vain
hopes and concupiscence, and thou shalt hold him up that is desirous
always to serve thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,6);</script>Let not the greediness
of the belly nor lust of the flesh take hold of me; and give not over me
thy servant into an impudent mind.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,7);</script>Hear, O ye children,
the discipline of the mouth: he that keepeth it shall never be taken in
his lips.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,8);</script>The sinner shall be
left in his foolishness: both the evil speaker and the proud shall fall
thereby.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,9);</script>Accustom not thy mouth
to swearing; neither use thyself to the naming of the Holy One.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,10);</script>For as a servant that
is continually beaten shall not be without a blue mark: so he that
sweareth and nameth God continually shall not be faultless.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,11);</script>A man that useth much
swearing shall be filled with iniquity, and the plague shall never depart
from his house: if he shall offend, his sin shall be upon him: and if he
acknowledge not his sin, he maketh a double offence: and if he swear in
vain, he shall not be innocent, but his house shall be full of calamities.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,12);</script>There is a word that
is clothed about with death: God grant that it be not found in the
heritage of Jacob; for all such things shall be far from the godly, and
they shall not wallow in their sins.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,13);</script>Use not thy mouth to
intemperate swearing, for therein is the word of sin.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,14);</script>Remember thy father
and thy mother, when thou sittest among great men. Be not forgetful before
them, and so thou by thy custom become a fool, and wish that thou hadst
not been born, and curse they day of thy nativity.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,15);</script>The man that is
accustomed to opprobrious words will never be reformed all the days of his
life.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,16);</script>Two sorts of men
multiply sin, and the third will bring wrath: a hot mind is as a burning
fire, it will never be quenched till it be consumed: a fornicator in the
body of his flesh will never cease till he hath kindled a fire.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,17);</script>All bread is sweet to
a whoremonger, he will not leave off till he die.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,18);</script>A man that breaketh
wedlock, saying thus in his heart, Who seeth me? I am compassed about with
darkness, the walls cover me, and no body seeth me; what need I to fear?
the most High will not remember my sins:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,19);</script>Such a man only
feareth the eyes of men, and knoweth not that the eyes of the Lord are ten
thousand times brighter than the sun, beholding all the ways of men, and
considering the most secret parts.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,20);</script>He knew all things
ere ever they were created; so also after they were perfected he looked
upon them all.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,21);</script>This man shall be
punished in the streets of the city, and where he suspecteth not he shall
be taken.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,22);</script>Thus shall it go also
with the wife that leaveth her husband, and bringeth in an heir by another.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,23);</script>For first, she hath
disobeyed the law of the most High; and secondly, she hath trespassed
against her own husband; and thirdly, she hath played the whore in
adultery, and brought children by another man.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,24);</script>She shall be brought
out into the congregation, and inquisition shall be made of her children.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,25);</script>Her children shall
not take root, and her branches shall bring forth no fruit.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,26);</script>She shall leave her
memory to be cursed, and her reproach shall not be blotted out.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,27);</script>And they that remain
shall know that there is nothing better than the fear of the Lord, and
that there is nothing sweeter than to take heed unto the commandments of
the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,28);</script>It is great glory to
follow the Lord, and to be received of him is long life.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,1);</script>Wisdom shall praise
herself, and shall glory in the midst of her people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,2);</script>In the congregation of
the most High shall she open her mouth, and triumph before his power.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,3);</script>I came out of the
mouth of the most High, and covered the earth as a cloud.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,4);</script>I dwelt in high
places, and my throne is in a cloudy pillar.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,5);</script>I alone compassed the
circuit of heaven, and walked in the bottom of the deep.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,6);</script>In the waves of the
sea and in all the earth, and in every people and nation, I got a
possession.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,7);</script>With all these I
sought rest: and in whose inheritance shall I abide?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,8);</script>So the Creator of all
things gave me a commandment, and he that made me caused my tabernacle to
rest, and said, Let thy dwelling be in Jacob, and thine inheritance in
Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,9);</script>He created me from the
beginning before the world, and I shall never fail.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,10);</script>In the holy
tabernacle I served before him; and so was I established in Sion.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,11);</script>Likewise in the
beloved city he gave me rest, and in Jerusalem was my power.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,12);</script>And I took root in an
honourable people, even in the portion of the Lord’s inheritance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,13);</script>I was exalted like a
cedar in Libanus, and as a cypress tree upon the mountains of Hermon.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,14);</script>I was exalted like a
palm tree in En-gaddi, and as a rose plant in Jericho, as a fair olive
tree in a pleasant field, and grew up as a plane tree by the water.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,15);</script>I gave a sweet smell
like cinnamon and aspalathus, and I yielded a pleasant odour like the best
myrrh, as galbanum, and onyx, and sweet storax, and as the fume of
frankincense in the tabernacle.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,16);</script>As the turpentine
tree I stretched out my branches, and my branches are the branches of
honour and grace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,17);</script>As the vine brought I
forth pleasant savour, and my flowers are the fruit of honour and riches.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,18);</script>I am the mother of
fair love, and fear, and knowledge, and holy hope: I therefore, being
eternal, am given to all my children which are named of him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,19);</script>Come unto me, all ye
that be desirous of me, and fill yourselves with my fruits.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,20);</script>For my memorial is
sweeter than honey, and mine inheritance than the honeycomb.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,21);</script>They that eat me
shall yet be hungry, and they that drink me shall yet be thirsty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,22);</script>He that obeyeth me
shall never be confounded, and they that work by me shall not do amiss.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,23);</script>All these things are
the book of the covenant of the most high God, even the law which Moses
commanded for an heritage unto the congregations of Jacob.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,24);</script>Faint not to be
strong in the Lord; that he may confirm you, cleave unto him: for the Lord
Almighty is God alone, and beside him there is no other Saviour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,25);</script>He filleth all things
with his wisdom, as Phison and as Tigris in the time of the new fruits.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,26);</script>He maketh the
understanding to abound like Euphrates, and as Jordan in the time of the
harvest.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,27);</script>He maketh the
doctrine of knowledge appear as the light, and as Geon in the time of
vintage.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,28);</script>The first man knew
her not perfectly: no more shall the last find her out.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,29);</script>For her thoughts are
more than the sea, and her counsels profounder than the great deep.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,30);</script>I also came out as a
brook from a river, and as a conduit into a garden.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,31);</script>I said, I will water
my best garden, and will water abundantly my garden bed: and, lo, my brook
became a river, and my river became a sea.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,32);</script>I will yet make
doctrine to shine as the morning, and will send forth her light afar off.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,33);</script>I will yet pour out
doctrine as prophecy, and leave it to all ages for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,34);</script>Behold that I have
not laboured for myself only, but for all them that seek wisdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,1);</script>In three things I was
beautified, and stood up beautiful both before God and men: the unity of
brethren, the love of neighbours, a man and a wife that agree together.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,2);</script>Three sorts of men my
soul hateth, and I am greatly offended at their life: a poor man that is
proud, a rich man that is a liar, and an old adulterer that doateth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,3);</script>If thou hast gathered
nothing in thy youth, how canst thou find any thing in thine age?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,4);</script>O how comely a thing
is judgment for gray hairs, and for ancient men to know counsel!
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,5);</script>O how comely is the
wisdom of old men, and understanding and counsel to men of honour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,6);</script>Much experience is the
crown of old men, and the fear of God is their glory.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,7);</script>There be nine things
which I have judged in mine heart to be happy, and the tenth I will utter
with my tongue: A man that hath joy of his children; and he that liveth to
see the fall of his enemy:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,8);</script>Well is him that
dwelleth with a wife of understanding, and that hath not slipped with his
tongue, and that hath not served a man more unworthy than himself:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,9);</script>Well is him that hath
found prudence, and he that speaketh in the ears of them that will hear:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,10);</script>O how great is he
that findeth wisdom! yet is there none above him that feareth the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,11);</script>But the love of the
Lord passeth all things for illumination: he that holdeth it, whereto
shall he be likened?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,12);</script>The fear of the Lord
is the beginning of his love: and faith is the beginning of cleaving unto
him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,13);</script><I>Give me</I> any
plague, but the plague of the heart: and any wickedness, but the
wickedness of a woman:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,14);</script>And any affliction,
but the affliction from them that hate me: and any revenge, but the
revenge of enemies.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,15);</script>There is no head
above the head of a serpent; and there is no wrath above the wrath of an
enemy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,16);</script>I had rather dwell
with a lion and a dragon, than to keep house with a wicked woman.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,17);</script>The wickedness of a
woman changeth her face, and darkeneth her countenance like sackcloth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,18);</script>Her husband shall sit
among his neighbours; and when he heareth it shall sigh bitterly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,19);</script>All wickedness is but
little to the wickedness of a woman: let the portion of a sinner fall upon
her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,20);</script>As the climbing up a
sandy way is to the feet of the aged, so is a wife full of words to a
quiet man.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,21);</script>Stumble not at the
beauty of a woman, and desire her not for pleasure.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,22);</script>A woman, if she
maintain her husband, is full of anger, impudence, and much reproach.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,23);</script>A wicked woman
abateth the courage, maketh an heavy countenance and a wounded heart: a
woman that will not comfort her husband in distress maketh weak hands and
feeble knees.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,24);</script>Of the woman came the
beginning of sin, and through her we all die.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,25);</script>Give the water no
passage; neither a wicked woman liberty to gad abroad.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,26);</script>If she go not as thou
wouldest have her, cut her off from thy flesh, and give her a bill of
divorce, and let her go.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,1);</script>Blessed is the man
that hath a virtuous wife, for the number of his days shall be double.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,2);</script>A virtuous woman
rejoiceth her husband, and he shall fulfil the years of his life in peace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,3);</script>A good wife is a good
portion, which shall be given in the portion of them that fear the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,4);</script>Whether a man be rich
or poor, if he have a good heart toward the Lord, he shall at all times
rejoice with a cheerful countenance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,5);</script>There be three things
that mine heart feareth; and for the fourth I was sore afraid: the slander
of a city, the gathering together of an unruly multitude, and a false
accusation: all these are worse than death.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,6);</script>But a grief of heart
and sorrow is a woman that is jealous over another woman, and a scourge of
the tongue which communicateth with all.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,7);</script>An evil wife is a yoke
shaken to and fro: he that hath hold of her is as though he held a
scorpion.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,8);</script>A drunken woman and a
gadder abroad causeth great anger, and she will not cover her own shame.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,9);</script>The whoredom of a
woman may be known in her haughty looks and eyelids.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,10);</script>If thy daughter be
shameless, keep her in straitly, lest she abuse herself through overmuch
liberty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,11);</script>Watch over an
impudent eye: and marvel not if she trespass against thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,12);</script>She will open her
mouth, as a thirsty traveller when he hath found a fountain, and drink of
every water near her: by every hedge will she sit down, and open her
quiver against every arrow.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,13);</script>The grace of a wife
delighteth her husband, and her discretion will fatten his bones.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,14);</script>A silent and loving
woman is a gift of the Lord; and there is nothing so much worth as a mind
well instructed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,15);</script>A shamefaced and
faithful woman is a double grace, and her continent mind cannot be valued.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,16);</script>As the sun when it
ariseth in the high heaven; so is the beauty of a good wife in the
ordering of her house.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,17);</script>As the clear light is
upon the holy candlestick; so is the beauty of the face in ripe age.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,18);</script>As the golden pillars
are upon the sockets of silver; so are the fair feet with a constant heart.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,19);</script>My son, keep the
flower of thine age sound; and give not thy strength to strangers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,20);</script>When thou hast gotten
a fruitful possession through all the field, sow it with thine own seed,
trusting in the goodness of thy stock.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,21);</script>So thy race which
thou leavest shall be magnified, having the confidence of their good
descent.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,22);</script>An harlot shall be
accounted as spittle; but a married woman is a tower against death to her
husband.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,23);</script>A wicked woman is
given as a portion to a wicked man: but a godly woman is given to him that
feareth the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,24);</script>A dishonest woman
contemneth shame: but an honest woman will reverence her husband.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,25);</script>A shameless woman
shall be counted as a dog; but she that is shamefaced will fear the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,26);</script>A woman that
honoureth her husband shall be judged wise of all; but she that
dishonoureth him in her pride shall be counted ungodly of all.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,27);</script>A loud crying woman
and a scold shall be sought out to drive away the enemies.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,28);</script>There be two things
that grieve my heart; and the third maketh me angry: a man of war that
suffereth poverty; and men of understanding that are not set by; and one
that returneth from righteousness to sin; the Lord prepareth such an one
for the sword.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,29);</script>A merchant shall
hardly keep himself from doing wrong; and an huckster shall not be freed
from sin.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,1);</script>Many have sinned for a
small matter; and he that seeketh for abundance will turn his eyes away.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,2);</script>As a nail sticketh
fast between the joinings of the stones; so doth sin stick close between
buying and selling.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,3);</script>Unless a man hold
himself diligently in the fear of the Lord, his house shall soon be
overthrown.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,4);</script>As when one sifteth
with a sieve, the refuse remaineth; so the filth of man in his talk.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,5);</script>The furnace proveth
the potter’s vessels; so the trial of man is in his reasoning.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,6);</script>The fruit declareth if
the tree have been dressed; so is the utterance of a conceit in the heart
of man.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,7);</script>Praise no man before
thou hearest him speak; for this is the trial of men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,8);</script>If thou followest
righteousness, thou shalt obtain her, and put her on, as a glorious long
robe.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,9);</script>The birds will resort
unto their like; so will truth return unto them that practise in her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,10);</script>As the lion lieth in
wait for the prey; so sin for them that work iniquity.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,11);</script>The discourse of a
godly man is always with wisdom; but a fool changeth as the moon.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,12);</script>If thou be among the
indiscreet, observe the time; but be continually among men of
understanding.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,13);</script>The discourse of
fools is irksome, and their sport is the wantonness of sin.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,14);</script>The talk of him that
sweareth much maketh the hair stand upright; and their brawls make one
stop his ears.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,15);</script>The strife of the
proud is bloodshedding, and their revilings are grievous to the ear.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,16);</script>Whoso discovereth
secrets loseth his credit; and shall never find friend to his mind.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,17);</script>Love thy friend, and
be faithful unto him: but if thou betrayest his secrets, follow no more
after him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,18);</script>For as a man hath
destroyed his enemy; so hast thou lost the love of thy neighbor.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,19);</script>As one that letteth a
bird go out of his hand, so hast thou let thy neighbour go, and shalt not
get him again
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,20);</script>Follow after him no
more, for he is too far off; he is as a roe escaped out of the snare.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,21);</script>As for a wound, it
may be bound up; and after reviling there may be reconcilement: but he
that betrayeth secrets is without hope.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,22);</script>He that winketh with
the eyes worketh evil: and he that knoweth him will depart from him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,23);</script>When thou art
present, he will speak sweetly, and will admire thy words: but at the last
he will writhe his mouth, and slander thy sayings.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,24);</script>I have hated many
things, but nothing like him; for the Lord will hate him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,25);</script>Whoso casteth a stone
on high casteth it on his own head; and a deceitful stroke shall make
wounds.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,26);</script>Whoso diggeth a pit
shall fall therein: and he that setteth a trap shall be taken therein.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,27);</script>He that worketh
mischief, it shall fall upon him, and he shall not know whence it cometh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,28);</script>Mockery and reproach
are from the proud; but vengeance, as a lion, shall lie in wait for them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,29);</script>They that rejoice at
the fall of the righteous shall be taken in the snare; and anguish shall
consume them before they die.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,30);</script>Malice and wrath,
even these are abominations; and the sinful man shall have them both.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,1);</script>He that revengeth
shall find vengeance from the Lord, and he will surely keep his sins <I>in
remembrance.</I>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,2);</script>Forgive thy neighbour
the hurt that he hath done unto thee, so shall thy sins also be forgiven
when thou prayest.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,3);</script>One man beareth hatred
against another, and doth he seek pardon from the Lord?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,4);</script>He sheweth no mercy to
a man, which is like himself: and doth he ask forgiveness of his own sins?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,5);</script>If he that is but
flesh nourish hatred, who will intreat for pardon of his sins?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,6);</script>Remember thy end, and
let enmity cease; <I>remember</I> corruption and death, and abide in the
commandments.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,7);</script>Remember the
commandments, and bear no malice to thy neighbour: <I>remember</I> the
covenant of the Highest, and wink at ignorance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,8);</script>Abstain from strife,
and thou shalt diminish thy sins: for a furious man will kindle strife,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,9);</script>A sinful man
disquieteth friends, and maketh debate among them that be at peace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,10);</script>As the matter of the
fire is, so it burneth: and as a man’s strength is, so is his wrath; and
according to his riches his anger riseth; and the stronger they are which
contend, the more they will be inflamed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,11);</script>An hasty contention
kindleth a fire: and an hasty fighting sheddeth blood.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,12);</script>If thou blow the
spark, it shall burn: if thou spit upon it, it shall be quenched: and both
these come out of thy mouth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,13);</script>Curse the whisperer
and doubletongued: for such have destroyed many that were at peace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,14);</script>A backbiting tongue
hath disquieted many, and driven them from nation to nation: strong cities
hath it pulled down, and overthrown the houses of great men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,15);</script>A backbiting tongue
hath cast out virtuous women, and deprived them of their labours.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,16);</script>Whoso hearkeneth unto
it shall never find rest, and never dwell quietly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,17);</script>The stroke of the
whip maketh marks in the flesh: but the stroke of the tongue breaketh the
bones.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,18);</script>Many have fallen by
the edge of the sword: but not so many as have fallen by the tongue.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,19);</script>Well is he that is
defended through the venom thereof; who hath not drawn the yoke thereof,
nor hath been bound in her bands.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,20);</script>For the yoke thereof
is a yoke of iron, and the bands thereof are bands of brass.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,21);</script>The death thereof is
an evil death, the grave were better than it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,22);</script>It shall not have
rule over them that fear God, neither shall they be burned with the flame
thereof.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,23);</script>Such as forsake the
Lord shall fall into it; and it shall burn in them, and not be quenched;
it shall be sent upon them as a lion, and devour them as a leopard.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,24);</script>Look that thou hedge
thy possession about with thorns, and bind up thy silver and gold,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,25);</script>And weigh thy words
in a balance, and make a door and bar for thy mouth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,26);</script>Beware thou slide not
by it, lest thou fall before him that lieth in wait.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,1);</script>He that is merciful
will lend unto his neighbour; and he that strengtheneth his hand keepeth
the commandments.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,2);</script>Lend to thy neighbour
in time of his need, and pay thou thy neighbour again in due season.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,3);</script>Keep thy word, and
deal faithfully with him, and thou shalt always find the thing that is
necessary for thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,4);</script>Many, when a thing was
lent them, reckoned it to be found, and put them to trouble that helped
them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,5);</script>Till he hath received,
he will kiss a man’s hand; and for his neighbour’s money he will speak
submissly: but when he should repay, he will prolong the time, and return
words of grief, and complain of the time.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,6);</script>If he prevail, he
shall hardly receive the half, and he will count as if he had found it: if
not, he hath deprived him of his money, and he hath gotten him an enemy
without cause: he payeth him with cursings and railings; and for honour he
will pay him disgrace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,7);</script>Many therefore have
refused to lend for other men’s ill dealing, fearing to be defrauded.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,8);</script>Yet have thou patience
with a man in poor estate, and delay not to shew him mercy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,9);</script>Help the poor for the
commandment’s sake, and turn him not away because of his poverty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,10);</script>Lose thy money for
thy brother and thy friend, and let it not rust under a stone to be lost.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,11);</script>Lay up thy treasure
according to the commandments of the most High, and it shall bring thee
more profit than gold.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,12);</script>Shut up alms in thy
storehouses: and it shall deliver thee from all affliction.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,13);</script>It shall fight for
thee against thine enemies better than a mighty shield and strong spear.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,14);</script>An honest man is
surety for his neighbour: but he that is impudent will forsake him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,15);</script>Forget not the
friendship of thy surety, for he hath given his life for thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,16);</script>A sinner will
overthrow the good estate of his surety:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,17);</script>And he that is of an
unthankful mind will leave him <I>in danger</I> that delivered him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,18);</script>Suretiship hath
undone many of good estate, and shaken them as a wave of the sea: mighty
men hath it driven from their houses, so that they wandered among strange
nations.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,19);</script>A wicked man
transgressing the commandments of the Lord shall fall into suretiship: and
he that undertaketh and followeth other men’s business for gain shall
fall into suits.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,20);</script>Help thy neighbour
according to thy power, and beware that thou thyself fall not into the
same.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,21);</script>The chief thing for
life is water, and bread, and clothing, and an house to cover shame.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,22);</script>Better is the life of
a poor man in a mean cottage, than delicate fare in another man’s house.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,23);</script>Be it little or much,
hold thee contented, that thou hear not the reproach of thy house.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,24);</script>For it is a miserable
life to go from house to house: for where thou art a stranger, thou darest
not open thy mouth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,25);</script>Thou shalt entertain,
and feast, and have no thanks: moreover thou shalt hear bitter words:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,26);</script>Come, thou stranger,
and furnish a table, and feed me of that thou hast ready.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,27);</script>Give place, thou
stranger, to an honourable man; my brother cometh to be lodged, and I have
need of mine house.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,28);</script>These things are
grievous to a man of understanding; the upbraiding of houseroom, and
reproaching of the lender.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,1);</script>He that loveth his son
causeth him oft to feel the rod, that he may have joy of him in the end.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,2);</script>He that chastiseth his
son shall have joy in him, and shall rejoice of him among his acquaintance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,3);</script>He that teacheth his
son grieveth the enemy: and before his friends he shall rejoice of him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,4);</script>Though his father die,
yet he is as though he were not dead: for he hath left one behind him that
is like himself.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,5);</script>While he lived, he saw
and rejoiced in him: and when he died, he was not sorrowful.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,6);</script>He left behind him an
avenger against his enemies, and one that shall requite kindness to his
friends.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,7);</script>He that maketh too
much of his son shall bind up his wounds; and his bowels will be troubled
at every cry.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,8);</script>An horse not broken
becometh headstrong: and a child left to himself will be wilful.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,9);</script>Cocker thy child, and
he shall make thee afraid: play with him, and he will bring thee to
heaviness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,10);</script>Laugh not with him,
lest thou have sorrow with him, and lest thou gnash thy teeth in the end.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,11);</script>Give him no liberty
in his youth, and wink not at his follies.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,12);</script>Bow down his neck
while he is young, and beat him on the sides while he is a child, lest he
wax stubborn, and be disobedient unto thee, and so bring sorrow to thine
heart.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,13);</script>Chastise thy son, and
hold him to labour, lest his lewd behaviour be an offence unto thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,14);</script>Better is the poor,
being sound and strong of constitution, than a rich man that is afflicted
in his body.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,15);</script>Health and good
estate of body are above all gold, and a strong body above infinite wealth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,16);</script>There is no riches
above a sound body, and no joy above the joy of the heart.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,17);</script>Death is better than
a bitter life or continual sickness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,18);</script>Delicates poured upon
a mouth shut up are as messes of meat set upon a grave.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,19);</script>What good doeth the
offering unto an idol? for neither can it eat nor smell: so is he that is
persecuted of the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,20);</script>He seeth with his
eyes and groaneth, as an eunuch that embraceth a virgin and sigheth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,21);</script>Give not over thy
mind to heaviness, and afflict not thyself in thine own counsel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,22);</script>The gladness of the
heart is the life of man, and the joyfulness of a man prolongeth his days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,23);</script>Love thine own soul,
and comfort thy heart, remove sorrow far from thee: for sorrow hath killed
many, and there is no profit therein.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,24);</script>Envy and wrath
shorten the life, and carefulness bringeth age before the time.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,25);</script>A cheerful and good
heart will have a care of his meat and diet.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,1);</script>Watching for riches
consumeth the flesh, and the care thereof driveth away sleep.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,2);</script>Watching care will not
let a man slumber, as a sore disease breaketh sleep,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,3);</script>The rich hath great
labour in gathering riches together; and when he resteth, he is filled
with his delicates.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,4);</script>The poor laboureth in
his poor estate; and when he leaveth off, he is still needy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,5);</script>He that loveth gold
shall not be justified, and he that followeth corruption shall have enough
thereof.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,6);</script>Gold hath been the
ruin of many, and their destruction was present.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,7);</script>It is a stumblingblock
unto them that sacrifice unto it, and every fool shall be taken therewith.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,8);</script>Blessed is the rich
that is found without blemish, and hath not gone after gold.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,9);</script>Who is he? and we will
call him blessed: for wonderful things hath he done among his people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,10);</script>Who hath been tried
thereby, and found perfect? then let him glory. Who might offend, and hath
not offended? or done evil, and hath not done it?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,11);</script>His goods shall be
established, and the congregation shall declare his alms.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,12);</script>If thou sit at a
bountiful table, be not greedy upon it, and say not, There is much meat on
it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,13);</script>Remember that a
wicked eye is an evil thing: and what is created more wicked than an eye?
therefore it weepeth upon every occasion.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,14);</script>Stretch not thine
hand whithersoever it looketh, and thrust it not with him into the dish.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,15);</script>Judge not thy
neighbour by thyself: and be discreet in every point.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,16);</script>Eat as it becometh a
man, those things which are set before thee; and devour note, lest thou be
hated.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,17);</script>Leave off first for
manners’ sake; and be not unsatiable, lest thou offend.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,18);</script>When thou sittest
among many, reach not thine hand out first of all.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,19);</script>A very little is
sufficient for a man well nurtured, and he fetcheth not his wind short
upon his bed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,20);</script>Sound sleep cometh of
moderate eating: he riseth early, and his wits are with him: but the pain
of watching, and choler, and pangs of the belly, are with an unsatiable
man.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,21);</script>And if thou hast been
forced to eat, arise, go forth, vomit, and thou shalt have rest.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,22);</script>My son, hear me, and
despise me not, and at the last thou shalt find as I told thee: in all thy
works be quick, so shall there no sickness come unto thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,23);</script>Whoso is liberal of
his meat, men shall speak well of him; and the report of his good
housekeeping will be believed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,24);</script>But against him that
is a niggard of his meat the whole city shall murmur; and the testimonies
of his niggardness shall not be doubted of.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,25);</script>Shew not thy
valiantness in wine; for wine hath destroyed many.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,26);</script>The furnace proveth
the edge by dipping: so doth wine the hearts of the proud by drunkeness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,27);</script>Wine is as good as
life to a man, if it be drunk moderately: what life is then to a man that
is without wine? for it was made to make men glad.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,28);</script>Wine measurably drunk
and in season bringeth gladness of the heart, and cheerfulness of the mind:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,29);</script>But wine drunken with
excess maketh bitterness of the mind, with brawling and quarrelling.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,30);</script>Drunkenness
increaseth the rage of a fool till he offend: it diminisheth strength, and
maketh wounds.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,31);</script>Rebuke not thy
neighbour at the wine, and despise him not in his mirth: give him no
despiteful words, and press not upon him with urging him <I>to drink.</I>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,1);</script>If thou be made the
master <I>of a feast,</I> lift not thyself up, but be among them as one of
the rest; take diligent care for them, and so sit down.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,2);</script>And when thou hast
done all thy office, take thy place, that thou mayest be merry with them,
and receive a crown for thy well ordering of the feast.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,3);</script>Speak, thou that art
the elder, for it becometh thee, but with sound judgment; and hinder not
musick.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,4);</script>Pour not out words
where there is a musician, and shew not forth wisdom out of time.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,5);</script>A concert of musick in
a banquet of wine is as a signet of carbuncle set in gold.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,6);</script>As a signet of an
emerald set in a work of gold, so is the melody of musick with pleasant
wine.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,7);</script>Speak, young man, if
there be need of thee: and yet scarcely when thou art twice asked.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,8);</script>Let thy speech be
short, comprehending much in few words; be as one that knoweth and yet
holdeth his tongue.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,9);</script>If thou be among great
men, make not thyself equal with them; and when ancient men are in place,
use not many words.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,10);</script>Before the thunder
goeth lightning; and before a shamefaced man shall go favour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,11);</script>Rise up betimes, and
be not the last; but get thee home without delay.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,12);</script>There take thy
pastime, and do what thou wilt: but sin not by proud speech.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,13);</script>And for these things
bless him that made thee, and hath replenished thee with his good things.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,14);</script>Whoso feareth the
Lord will receive his discipline; and they that seek him early shall find
favour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,15);</script>He that seeketh the
law shall be filled therewith: but the hypocrite will be offended thereat.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,16);</script>They that fear the
Lord shall find judgment, and shall kindle justice as a light.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,17);</script>A sinful man will not
be reproved, but findeth an excuse according to his will.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,18);</script>A man of counsel will
be considerate; but a strange and proud man is not daunted with fear, even
when of himself he hath done without counsel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,19);</script>Do nothing without
advice; and when thou hast once done, repent not.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,20);</script>Go not in a way
wherein thou mayest fall, and stumble not among the stones.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,21);</script>Be not confident in a
plain way.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,22);</script>And beware of thine
own children.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,23);</script>In every good work
trust thy own soul; for this is the keeping of the commandments.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,24);</script>He that believeth in
the Lord taketh heed to the commandment; and he that trusteth in him shall
fare never the worse.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,1);</script>There shall no evil
happen unto him that feareth the Lord; but in temptation even again he
will deliver him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,2);</script>A wise man hateth not
the law; but he that is an hypocrite therein is as a ship in a storm.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,3);</script>A man of understanding
trusteth in the law; and the law is faithful unto him, as an oracle.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,4);</script>Prepare what to say,
and so thou shalt be heard: and bind up instruction, and then make answer.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,5);</script>The heart of the
foolish is like a cartwheel; and his thoughts are like a rolling axletree.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,6);</script>A stallion horse is as
a mocking friend, he neigheth under every one that sitteth upon him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,7);</script>Why doth one day excel
another, when as all the light of every day in the year is of the sun?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,8);</script>By the knowledge of
the Lord they were distinguished: and he altered seasons and feasts.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,9);</script>Some of them hath he
made high days, and hallowed them, and some of them hath he made ordinary
days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,10);</script>And all men are from
the ground, and Adam was created of earth:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,11);</script>In much knowledge the
Lord hath divided them, and made their ways diverse.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,12);</script>Some of them hath he
blessed and exalted and some of them he sanctified, and set near himself:
but some of them hath he cursed and brought low, and turned out of their
places.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,13);</script>As the clay is in the
potter’s hand, to fashion it at his pleasure: so man is in the hand of
him that made him, to render to them as liketh him best.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,14);</script>Good is set against
evil, and life against death: so is the godly against the sinner, and the
sinner against the godly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,15);</script>So look upon all the
works of the most High; and there are two and two, one against another.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,16);</script>I awaked up last of
all, as one that gathereth after the grapegatherers: by the blessing of
the Lord I profited, and tred my winepress like a gatherer of grapes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,17);</script>Consider that I
laboured not for myself only, but for all them that seek learning.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,18);</script>Hear me, O ye great
men of the people, and hearken with your ears, ye rulers of the
congregation.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,19);</script>Give not thy son and
wife, thy brother and friend, power over thee while thou livest, and give
not thy goods to another: lest it repent thee, and thou intreat for the
same again.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,20);</script>As long as thou
livest and hast breath in thee, give not thyself over to any.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,21);</script>For better it is that
thy children should seek to thee, than that thou shouldest stand to their
courtesy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,22);</script>In all thy works keep
to thyself the preeminence; leave not a stain in thine honour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,23);</script>At the time when thou
shalt end thy days, and finish thy life, distribute thine inheritance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,24);</script>Fodder, a wand, and
burdens, are for the ass; and bread, correction, and work, for a servant. .
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,25);</script>If thou set thy
servant to labour, thou shalt find rest: but if thou let him go idle, he
shall seek liberty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,26);</script>A yoke and a collar
do bow the neck: so are tortures and torments for an evil servant.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,27);</script>Send him to labour,
that he be not idle; for idleness teacheth much evil.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,28);</script>Set him to work, as
is fit for him: if he be not obedient, put on more heavy fetters.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,29);</script>But be not excessive
toward any; and without discretion do nothing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,30);</script>If thou have a
servant, let him be unto thee as thyself, because thou hast bought him
with a price.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,31);</script>If thou have a
servant, entreat him as a brother: for thou hast need of him, as of thine
own soul: if thou entreat him evil, and he run from thee, which way wilt
thou go to seek him?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,1);</script>The hopes of a man
void of understanding are vain and false: and dreams lift up fools.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,2);</script>Whoso regardeth dreams
is like him that catcheth at a shadow, and followeth after the wind.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,3);</script>The vision of dreams
is the resemblance of one thing to another, even as the likeness of a face
to a face.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,4);</script>Of an unclean thing
what can be cleansed? and from that thing which is false what truth can
come?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,5);</script>Divinations, and
soothsayings, and dreams, are vain: and the heart fancieth, as a woman’s
heart in travail.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,6);</script>If they be not sent
from the most High in thy visitation, set not thy heart upon them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,7);</script>For dreams have
deceived many, and they have failed that put their trust in them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,8);</script>The law shall be found
perfect without lies: and wisdom is perfection to a faithful mouth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,9);</script>A man that hath
travelled knoweth many things; and he that hath much experience will
declare wisdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,10);</script>He that hath no
experience knoweth little: but he that hath travelled is full of prudence.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,11);</script>When I travelled, I
saw many things; and I understand more than I can express.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,12);</script>I was ofttimes in
danger of death: yet I was delivered because of these things.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,13);</script>The spirit of those
that fear the Lord shall live; for their hope is in him that saveth them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,14);</script>Whoso feareth the
Lord shall not fear nor be afraid; for he is his hope.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,15);</script>Blessed is the soul
of him that feareth the Lord: to whom doth he look? and who is his
strength?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,16);</script>For the eyes of the
Lord are upon them that love him, he is their mighty protection and strong
stay, a defence from heat, and a cover from the sun at noon, a
preservation from stumbling, and an help from falling.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,17);</script>He raiseth up the
soul, and lighteneth the eyes: he giveth health, life, and blessing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,18);</script>He that sacrificeth
of a thing wrongfully gotten, his offering is ridiculous; and the gifts of
unjust men are not accepted.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,19);</script>The most High is not
pleased with the offerings of the wicked; neither is he pacified for sin
by the multitude of sacrifices.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,20);</script>Whoso bringeth an
offering of the goods of the poor doeth as one that killeth the son before
his father’s eyes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,21);</script>The bread of the
needy is their life: he that defraudeth him thereof is a man of blood.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,22);</script>He that taketh away
his neighbour’s living slayeth him; and he that defraudeth the labourer
of his hire is a bloodshedder.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,23);</script>When one buildeth,
and another pulleth down, what profit have they then but labour?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,24);</script>When one prayeth, and
another curseth, whose voice will the Lord hear?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,25);</script>He that washeth
himself after the touching of a dead body, if he touch it again, what
availeth his washing?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,26);</script>So is it with a man
that fasteth for his sins, and goeth again, and doeth the same: who will
hear his prayer? or what doth his humbling profit him?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,1);</script>He that keepeth the
law bringeth offerings enough: he that taketh heed to the commandment
offereth a peace offering.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,2);</script>He that requiteth a
goodturn offereth fine flour; and he that giveth alms sacrificeth praise.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,3);</script>To depart from
wickedness is a thing pleasing to the Lord; and to forsake unrighteousness
is a propitiation.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,4);</script>Thou shalt not appear
empty before the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,5);</script>For all these things
<I>are to be done</I> because of the commandment.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,6);</script>The offering of the
righteous maketh the altar fat, and the sweet savour thereof is before the
most High.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,7);</script>The sacrifice of a
just man is acceptable. and the memorial thereof shall never be forgotten.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,8);</script>Give the Lord his
honour with a good eye, and diminish not the firstfruits of thine hands.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,9);</script>In all thy gifts shew
a cheerful countenance, and dedicate thy tithes with gladness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,10);</script>Give unto the most
High according as he hath enriched thee; and as thou hast gotten, give
with a cheerful eye.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,11);</script>For the Lord
recompenseth, and will give thee seven times as much.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,12);</script>Do not think to
corrupt with gifts; for such he will not receive: and trust not to
unrighteous sacrifices; for the Lord is judge, and with him is no respect
of persons.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,13);</script>He will not accept
any person against a poor man, but will hear the prayer of the oppressed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,14);</script>He will not despise
the supplication of the fatherless; nor the widow, when she poureth out
her complaint.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,15);</script>Do not the tears run
down the widow’s cheeks? and is not her cry against him that causeth
them to fall?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,16);</script>He that serveth the
Lord shall be accepted with favour, and his prayer shall reach unto the
clouds.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,17);</script>The prayer of the
humble pierceth the clouds: and till it come nigh, he will not be
comforted; and will not depart, till the most High shall behold to judge
righteously, and execute judgment.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,18);</script>For the Lord will not
be slack, neither will the Mighty be patient toward them, till he have
smitten in sunder the loins of the unmerciful, and repayed vengeance to
the heathen; till he have taken away the multitude of the proud, and
broken the sceptre of the unrighteous;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,19);</script>Till he have rendered
to every man according to his deeds, and to the works of men according to
their devices; till he have judged the cause of his people, and made them
to rejoice in his mercy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,20);</script>Mercy is seasonable
in the time of affliction, as clouds of rain in the time of drought.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,1);</script>Have mercy upon us, O
Lord God of all, and behold us:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,2);</script>And send thy fear upon
all the nations that seek not after thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,3);</script>Lift up thy hand
against the strange nations, and let them see thy power.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,4);</script>As thou wast
sanctified in us before them: so be thou magnified among them before us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,5);</script>And let them know
thee, as we have known thee, that there is no God but only thou, O God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,6);</script>Shew new signs, and
make other strange wonders: glorify thy hand and thy right arm, that they
may set forth thy wondrous works.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,7);</script>Raise up indignation,
and pour out wrath: take away the adversary, and destroy the enemy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,8);</script>Sake the time short,
remember the covenant, and let them declare thy wonderful works.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,9);</script>Let him that escapeth
be consumed by the rage of the fire; and let them perish that oppress the
people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,10);</script>Smite in sunder the
heads of the rulers of the heathen, that say, There is none other but we.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,11);</script>Gather all the tribes
of Jacob together, and inherit thou them, as from the beginning.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,12);</script>O Lord, have mercy
upon the people that is called by thy name, and upon Israel, whom thou
hast named thy firstborn.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,13);</script>O be merciful unto
Jerusalem, thy holy city, the place of thy rest.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,14);</script>Fill Sion with thine
unspeakable oracles, and thy people with thy glory:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,15);</script>Give testimony unto
those that thou hast possessed from the beginning, and raise up prophets
that have been in thy name.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,16);</script>Reward them that wait
for thee, and let thy prophets be found faithful.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,17);</script>O Lord, hear the
prayer of thy servants, according to the blessing of Aaron over thy
people, that all they which dwell upon the earth may know that thou art
the Lord, the eternal God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,18);</script>The belly devoureth
all meats, yet is one meat better than another.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,19);</script>As the palate tasteth
divers kinds of venison: so doth an heart of understanding false speeches.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,20);</script>A froward heart
causeth heaviness: but a man of experience will recompense him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,21);</script>A woman will receive
every man, yet is one daughter better than another.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,22);</script>The beauty of a woman
cheereth the countenance, and a man loveth nothing better.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,23);</script>If there be kindness,
meekness, and comfort, in her tongue, then is not her husband like other
men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,24);</script>He that getteth a
wife beginneth a possession, a help like unto himself, and a pillar of
rest.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,25);</script>Where no hedge is,
there the possession is spoiled: and he that hath no wife will wander up
and down mourning.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,26);</script>Who will trust a
thief well appointed, that skippeth from city to city? so <I>who will
believe</I> a man that hath no house, and lodgeth wheresoever the night
taketh him?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,1);</script>Every friend saith, I
am his friend also: but there is a friend, which is only a friend in name.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,2);</script>Is it not a grief unto
death, when a companion and friend is turned to an enemy?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,3);</script>O wicked imagination,
whence camest thou in to cover the earth with deceit?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,4);</script>There is a companion,
which rejoiceth in the prosperity of a friend, but in the time of trouble
will be against him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,5);</script>There is a companion,
which helpeth his friend for the belly, and taketh up the buckler against
the enemy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,6);</script>Forget not thy friend
in thy mind, and be not unmindful of him in thy riches.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,7);</script>Every counsellor
extolleth counsel; but there is some that counselleth for himself.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,8);</script>Beware of a
counsellor, and know before what need he hath; for he will counsel for
himself; lest he cast the lot upon thee,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,9);</script>And say unto thee, Thy
way is good: and afterward he stand on the other side, to see what shall
befall thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,10);</script>Consult not with one
that suspecteth thee: and hide thy counsel from such as envy thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,11);</script>Neither consult with
a woman touching her of whom she is jealous; neither with a coward in
matters of war; nor with a merchant concerning exchange; nor with a buyer
of selling; nor with an envious man of thankfulness; nor with an
unmerciful man touching kindness; nor with the slothful for any work; nor
with an hireling for a year of finishing work; nor with an idle servant of
much business: hearken not unto these in any matter of counsel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,12);</script>But be continually
with a godly man, whom thou knowest to keep the commandments of the Lord,
whose, mind is according to thy mind, and will sorrow with thee, if thou
shalt miscarry.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,13);</script>And let the counsel
of thine own heart stand: for there is no man more faithful unto thee than
it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,14);</script>For a man’s mind is
sometime wont to tell him more than seven watchmen, that sit above in an
high tower.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,15);</script>And above all this
pray to the most High, that he will direct thy way in truth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,16);</script>Let reason go before
every enterprize, and counsel before every action.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,17);</script>The countenance is a
sign of changing of the heart.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,18);</script>Four manner of things
appear: good and evil, life and death: but the tongue ruleth over them
continually.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,19);</script>There is one that is
wise and teacheth many, and yet is unprofitable to himself.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,20);</script>There is one that
sheweth wisdom in words, and is hated: he shall be destitute of all food.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,21);</script>For grace is not
given, him from the Lord, because he is deprived of all wisdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,22);</script>Another is wise to
himself; and the fruits of understanding are commendable in his mouth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,23);</script>A wise man
instructeth his people; and the fruits of his understanding fail not.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,24);</script>A wise man shall be
filled with blessing; and all they that see him shall count him happy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,25);</script>The days of the life
of man may be numbered: but the days of Israel are innumerable.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,26);</script>A wise man shall
inherit glory among his people, and his name shall be perpetual.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,27);</script>My son, prove thy
soul in thy life, and see what is evil for it, and give not that unto it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,28);</script>For all things are
not profitable for all men, neither hath every soul pleasure in every
thing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,29);</script>Be not unsatiable in
any dainty thing, nor too greedy upon meats:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,30);</script>For excess of meats
bringeth sickness, and surfeiting will turn into choler.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,31);</script>By surfeiting have
many perished; but he that taketh heed prolongeth his life.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,1);</script>Honour a physician
with the honour due unto him for the uses which ye may have of him: for
the Lord hath created him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,2);</script>For of the most High
cometh healing, and he shall receive honour of the king.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,3);</script>The skill of the
physician shall lift up his head: and in the sight of great men he shall
be in admiration.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,4);</script>The Lord hath created
medicines out of the earth; and he that is wise will not abhor them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,5);</script>Was not the water made
sweet with wood, that the virtue thereof might be known?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,6);</script>And he hath given men
skill, that he might be honoured in his marvellous works.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,7);</script>With such doth he heal
<I>men,</I> and taketh away their pains.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,8);</script>Of such doth the
apothecary make a confection; and of his works there is no end; and from
him is peace over all the earth,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,9);</script>My son, in thy
sickness be not negligent: but pray unto the Lord, and he will make thee
whole.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,10);</script>Leave off from sin,
and order thine hands aright, and cleanse thy heart from all wickedness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,11);</script>Give a sweet savour,
and a memorial of fine flour; and make a fat offering, as not being.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,12);</script>Then give place to
the physician, for the Lord hath created him: let him not go from thee,
for thou hast need of him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,13);</script>There is a time when
in their hands there is good success.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,14);</script>For they shall also
pray unto the Lord, that he would prosper that, which they give for ease
and remedy to prolong life.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,15);</script>He that sinneth
before his Maker, let him fall into the hand of the physician.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,16);</script>My son, let tears
fall down over the dead, and begin to lament, as if thou hadst suffered
great harm thyself; and then cover his body according to the custom, and
neglect not his burial.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,17);</script>Weep bitterly, and
make great moan, and use lamentation, as he is worthy, and that a day or
two, lest thou be evil spoken of: and then comfort thyself for thy
heaviness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,18);</script>For of heaviness
cometh death, and the heaviness of the heart breaketh strength.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,19);</script>In affliction also
sorrow remaineth: and the life of the poor is the curse of the heart.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,20);</script>Take no heaviness to
heart: drive it away, and member the last end.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,21);</script>Forget it not, for
there is no turning again: thou shalt not do him good, but hurt thyself.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,22);</script>Remember my judgment:
for thine also shall be so; yesterday for me, and to day for thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,23);</script>When the dead is at
rest, let his remembrance rest; and be comforted for him, when his Spirit
is departed from him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,24);</script>The wisdom of a
learned man cometh by opportunity of leisure: and he that hath little
business shall become wise.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,25);</script>How can he get wisdom
that holdeth the plough, and that glorieth in the goad, that driveth oxen,
and is occupied in their labours, and whose talk is of bullocks?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,26);</script>He giveth his mind to
make furrows; and is diligent to give the kine fodder.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,27);</script>So every carpenter
and workmaster, that laboureth night and day: and they that cut and grave
seals, and are diligent to make great variety, and give themselves to
counterfeit imagery, and watch to finish a work:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,28);</script>The smith also
sitting by the anvil, and considering the iron work, the vapour of the
fire wasteth his flesh, and he fighteth with the heat of the furnace: the
noise of the hammer and the anvil is ever in his ears, and his eyes look
still upon the pattern of the thing that he maketh; he setteth his mind to
finish his work, and watcheth to polish it perfectly:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,29);</script>So doth the potter
sitting at his work, and turning the wheel about with his feet, who is
alway carefully set at his work, and maketh all his work by number;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,30);</script>He fashioneth the
clay with his arm, and boweth down his strength before his feet; he
applieth himself to lead it over; and he is diligent to make clean the
furnace:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,31);</script>All these trust to
their hands: and every one is wise in his work.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,32);</script>Without these cannot
a city be inhabited: and they shall not dwell where they will, nor go up
and down:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,33);</script>They shall not be
sought for in publick counsel, nor sit high in the congregation: they
shall not sit on the judges’ seat, nor understand the sentence of
judgment: they cannot declare justice and judgment; and they shall not be
found where parables are spoken.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,34);</script>But they will
maintain the state of the world, and <I>all</I> their desire is in the
work of their craft.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,1);</script>But he that giveth his
mind to the law of the most High, and is occupied in the meditation
thereof, will seek out the wisdom of all the ancient, and be occupied in
prophecies.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,2);</script>He will keep the
sayings of the renowned men: and where subtil parables are, he will be
there also.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,3);</script>He will seek out the
secrets of grave sentences, and be conversant in dark parables.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,4);</script>He shall serve among
great men, and appear before princes: he will travel through strange
countries; for he hath tried the good and the evil among men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,5);</script>He will give his heart
to resort early to the Lord that made him, and will pray before the most
High, and will open his mouth in prayer, and make supplication for his
sins.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,6);</script>When the great Lord
will, he shall be filled with the spirit of understanding: he shall pour
out wise sentences, and give thanks unto the Lord in his prayer.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,7);</script>He shall direct his
counsel and knowledge, and in his secrets shall he meditate.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,8);</script>He shall shew forth
that which he hath learned, and shall glory in the law of the covenant of
the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,9);</script>Many shall commend his
understanding; and so long as the world endureth, it shall not be blotted
out; his memorial shall not depart away, and his name shall live from
generation to generation.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,10);</script>Nations shall shew
forth his wisdom, and the congregation shall declare his praise.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,11);</script>If he die, he shall
leave a greater name than a thousand: and if he live, he shall increase it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,12);</script>Yet have I more to
say, which I have thought upon; for I am filled as the moon at the full.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,13);</script>Hearken unto me, ye
holy children, and bud forth as a rose growing by the brook of the field:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,14);</script>And give ye a sweet
savour as frankincense, and flourish as a lily, send forth a smell, and
sing a song of praise, bless the Lord in all his works.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,15);</script>Magnify his name, and
shew forth his praise with the songs of your lips, and with harps, and in
praising him ye shall say after this manner:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,16);</script>All the works of the
Lord are exceeding good, and whatsoever he commandeth shall be
accomplished in due season.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,17);</script>And none may say,
What is this? wherefore is that? for at time convenient they shall all be
sought out: at his commandment the waters stood as an heap, and at the
words of his mouth the receptacles of waters.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,18);</script>At his commandment is
done whatsoever pleaseth him; and none can hinder, when he will save.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,19);</script>The works of all
flesh are before him, and nothing can be hid from his eyes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,20);</script>He seeth from
everlasting to everlasting; and there is nothing wonderful before him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,21);</script>A man need not to
say, What is this? wherefore is that? for he hath made all things for
their uses.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,22);</script>His blessing covered
the dry land as a river, and watered it as a flood.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,23);</script>As he hath turned the
waters into saltness: so shall the heathen inherit his wrath.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,24);</script>As his ways are plain
unto the holy; so are they stumblingblocks unto the wicked.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,25);</script>For the good are good
things created from the beginning: so evil things for sinners.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,26);</script>The principal things
for the whole use of man’s life are water, fire, iron, and salt, flour
of wheat, honey, milk, and the blood of the grape, and oil, and clothing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,27);</script>All these things are
for good to the godly: so to the sinners they are turned into evil.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,28);</script>There be spirits that
are created for vengeance, which in their fury lay on sore strokes; in the
time of destruction they pour out their force, and appease the wrath of
him that made them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,29);</script>Fire, and hail, and
famine, and death, all these were created for vengeance;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,30);</script>Teeth of wild beasts,
and scorpions, serpents, and the sword punishing the wicked to destruction.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,31);</script>They shall rejoice in
his commandment, and they shall be ready upon earth, when need is; and
when their time is come, they shall not transgress his word.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,32);</script>Therefore from the
beginning I was resolved, and thought upon these things, and have left
them in writing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,33);</script>All the works of the
Lord are good: and he will give every needful thing in due season.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,34);</script>So that a man cannot
say, This is worse than that: for in time they shall all be well approved.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,35);</script>And therefore praise
ye the Lord with the whole heart and mouth, and bless the name of the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,1);</script>Great travail is
created for every man, and an heavy yoke is upon the sons of Adam, from
the day that they go out of their mother’s womb, till the day that they
return to the mother of all things.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,2);</script>Their imagination of
things to come, and the day of death, <I>trouble</I> their thoughts, and
<I>cause</I> fear of heart;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,3);</script>From him that sitteth
on a throne of glory, unto him that is humbled in earth and ashes;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,4);</script>From him that weareth
purple and a crown, unto him that is clothed with a linen frock.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,5);</script>Wrath, and envy,
trouble, and unquietness, fear of death, and anger, and strife, and in the
time of rest upon his bed his night sleep, do change his knowledge.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,6);</script>A little or nothing is
his rest, and afterward he is in his sleep, as in a day of keeping watch,
troubled in the vision of his heart, as if he were escaped out of a battle.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,7);</script>When all is safe, he
awaketh, and marvelleth that the fear was nothing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,8);</script><I>Such things
happen</I> unto all flesh, both man and beast, and that is sevenfold more
upon sinners.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,9);</script>Death, and bloodshed,
strife, and sword, calamities, famine, tribulation, and the scourge;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,10);</script>These things are
created for the wicked, and for their sakes came the flood.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,11);</script>All things that are
of the earth shall turn to the earth again: and that which is of the
waters doth return into the sea.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,12);</script>All bribery and
injustice shall be blotted out: but true dealing shall endure for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,13);</script>The goods of the
unjust shall be dried up like a river, and shall vanish with noise, like a
great thunder in rain.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,14);</script>While he openeth his
hand he shall rejoice: so shall transgressors come to nought.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,15);</script>The children of the
ungodly shall not bring forth many branches: but are as unclean roots upon
a hard rock.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,16);</script>The weed growing upon
every water and bank of a river shall be pulled up before all grass.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,17);</script>Bountifulness is as a
most fruitful garden, and mercifulness endureth for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,18);</script>To labour, and to be
content with that a man hath, is a sweet life: but he that findeth a
treasure is above them both.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,19);</script>Children and the
building of a city continue a man’s name: but a blameless wife is
counted above them both.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,20);</script>Wine and musick
rejoice the heart: but the love of wisdom is above them both.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,21);</script>The pipe and the
psaltery make sweet melody: but a pleasant tongue is above them both.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,22);</script>Thine eye desireth
favour and beauty: but more than both corn while it is green.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,23);</script>A friend and
companion never meet amiss: but above both is a wife with her husband.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,24);</script>Brethren and help are
against time of trouble: but alms shall deliver more than them both.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,25);</script>Gold and silver make
the foot stand sure: but counsel is esteemed above them both.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,26);</script>Riches and strength
lift up the heart: but the fear of the Lord is above them both: there is
no want in the fear of the Lord, and it needeth not to seek help.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,27);</script>The fear of the Lord
is a fruitful garden, and covereth him above all glory.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,28);</script>My son, lead not a
beggar’s life; for better it is to die than to beg.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,29);</script>The life of him that
dependeth on another man’s table is not to be counted for a life; for he
polluteth himself with other men’s meat: but a wise man well nurtured
will beware thereof.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,30);</script>Begging is sweet in
the mouth of the shameless: but in his belly there shall burn a fire.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,1);</script>O death, how bitter is
the remembrance of thee to a man that liveth at rest in his possessions,
unto the man that hath nothing to vex him, and that hath prosperity in all
things: yea, unto him that is yet able to receive meat!
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,2);</script>O death, acceptable is
thy sentence unto the needy, and unto him whose strength faileth, that is
now in the last age, and is vexed with all things, and to him that
despaireth, and hath lost patience!
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,3);</script>Fear not the sentence
of death, remember them that have been before thee, and that come after;
for this is the sentence of the Lord over all flesh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,4);</script>And why art thou
against the pleasure of the most High? there is no inquisition in the
grave, whether thou have lived ten, or an hundred, or a thousand years.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,5);</script>The children of
sinners are abominable children, and they that are conversant in the
dwelling of the ungodly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,6);</script>The inheritance of
sinners’ children shall perish, and their posterity shall have a
perpetual reproach.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,7);</script>The children will
complain of an ungodly father, because they shall be reproached for his
sake.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,8);</script>Woe be unto you,
ungodly men, which have forsaken the law of the most high God! for if ye
increase, it shall be to your destruction:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,9);</script>And if ye be born, ye
shall be born to a curse: and if ye die, a curse shall be your portion.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,10);</script>All that are of the
earth shall turn to earth again: so the ungodly shall go from a curse to
destruction.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,11);</script>The mourning of men
is about their bodies: but an ill name of sinners shall be blotted out.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,12);</script>Have regard to thy
name; for that shall continue with thee above a thousand great treasures
of gold.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,13);</script>A good life hath but
few days: but a good name endureth for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,14);</script>My children, keep
discipline in peace: for wisdom that is hid, and a treasure that is not
seen, what profit is in them both?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,15);</script>A man that hideth his
foolishness is better than a man that hideth his wisdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,16);</script>Therefore be
shamefaced according to my word: for it is not good to retain all
shamefacedness; neither is it altogether approved in every thing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,17);</script>Be ashamed of
whoredom before father and mother: and of a lie before a prince and a
mighty man;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,18);</script>Of an offence before
a judge and ruler; of iniquity before a congregation and people; of unjust
dealing before thy partner and friend;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,19);</script>And of theft in
regard of the place where thou sojournest, and in regard of the truth of
God and his covenant; and to lean with thine elbow upon the meat; and of
scorning to give and take;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,20);</script>And of silence before
them that salute thee; and to look upon an harlot;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,21);</script>And to turn away thy
face from thy kinsman; or to take away a portion or a gift; or to gaze
upon another man’s wife.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,22);</script>Or to be overbusy
with his maid, and come not near her bed; or of upbraiding speeches before
friends; and after thou hast given, upbraid not;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,23);</script>Or of iterating and
speaking again that which thou hast heard; and of revealing of secrets.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,24);</script>So shalt thou be
truly shamefaced and find favour before all men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,1);</script>Of these things be not
thou ashamed, and accept no person to sin thereby:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,2);</script>Of the law of the most
High, and his covenant; and of judgment to justify the ungodly;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,3);</script>Of reckoning with thy
partners and travellers; or of the gift of the heritage of friends;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,4);</script>Of exactness of
balance and weights; or of getting much or little;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,5);</script>And of merchants’
indifferent selling; of much correction of children; and to make the side
of an evil servant to bleed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,6);</script>Sure keeping is good,
where an evil wife is; and shut up, where many hands are.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,7);</script>Deliver all things in
number and weight; and put all in writing that thou givest out, or
receivest in.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,8);</script>Be not ashamed to
inform the unwise and foolish, and the extreme aged that contendeth with
those that are young: thus shalt thou be truly learned, and approved of
all men living.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,9);</script>The father waketh for
the daughter, when no man knoweth; and the care for her taketh away sleep:
when she is young, lest she pass away the flower of her age; and being
married, lest she should be hated:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,10);</script>In her virginity,
lest she should be defiled and gotten with child in her father’s house;
and having an husband, lest she should misbehave herself; and when she is
married, lest she should be barren.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,11);</script>Keep a sure watch
over a shameless daughter, lest she make thee a laughingstock to thine
enemies, and a byword in the city, and a reproach among the people, and
make thee ashamed before the multitude.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,12);</script>Behold not every
body’s beauty, and sit not in the midst of women.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,13);</script>For from garments
cometh a moth, and from women wickedness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,14);</script>Better is the
churlishness of a man than a courteous woman, a woman, I say, which
bringeth shame and reproach.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,15);</script>I will now remember
the works of the Lord, and declare the things that I have seen: In the
words of the Lord are his works.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,16);</script>The sun that giveth
light looketh upon all things, and the work thereof is full of the glory
of the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,17);</script>The Lord hath not
given power to the saints to declare all his marvellous works, which the
Almighty Lord firmly settled, that whatsoever is might be established for
his glory.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,18);</script>He seeketh out the
deep, and the heart, and considereth their crafty devices: for the Lord
knoweth all that may be known, and he beholdeth the signs of the world.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,19);</script>He declareth the
things that are past, and for to come, and revealeth the steps of hidden
things.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,20);</script>No thought escapeth
him, neither any word is hidden from him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,21);</script>He hath garnished the
excellent works of his wisdom, and he is from everlasting to everlasting:
unto him may nothing be added, neither can he be diminished, and he hath
no need of any counsellor.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,22);</script>Oh how desirable are
all his works! and that a man may see even to a spark.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,23);</script>All these things live
and remain for ever for all uses, and they are all obedient.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,24);</script>All things are double
one against another: and he hath made nothing imperfect.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,25);</script>One thing
establisheth the good or another: and who shall be filled with beholding
his glory?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,1);</script>The pride of the
height, the clear firmament, the beauty of heaven, with his glorious shew;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,2);</script>The sun when it
appeareth, declaring at his rising a marvellous instrument, the work of
the most High:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,3);</script>At noon it parcheth
the country, and who can abide the burning heat thereof?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,4);</script>A man blowing a
furnace is in works of heat, but the sun burneth the mountains three times
more; breathing out fiery vapours, and sending forth bright beams, it
dimmeth the eyes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,5);</script>Great is the Lord that
made it; and at his commandment runneth hastily.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,6);</script>He made the moon also
to serve in her season for a declaration of times, and a sign of the world.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,7);</script>From the moon is the
sign of feasts, a light that decreaseth in her perfection.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,8);</script>The month is called
after her name, increasing wonderfully in her changing, being an
instrument of the armies above, shining in the firmament of heaven;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,9);</script>The beauty of heaven,
the glory of the stars, an ornament giving light in the highest places of
the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,10);</script>At the commandment of
the Holy One they will stand in their order, and never faint in their
watches.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,11);</script>Look upon the
rainbow, and praise him that made it; very beautiful it is in the
brightness thereof.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,12);</script>It compasseth the
heaven about with a glorious circle, and the hands of the most High have
bended it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,13);</script>By his commandment he
maketh the snow to fall aplace, and sendeth swiftly the lightnings of his
judgment.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,14);</script>Through this the
treasures are opened: and clouds fly forth as fowls.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,15);</script>By his great power he
maketh the clouds firm, and the hailstones are broken small.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,16);</script>At his sight the
mountains are shaken, and at his will the south wind bloweth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,17);</script>The noise of the
thunder maketh the earth to tremble: so doth the northern storm and the
whirlwind: as birds flying he scattereth the snow, and the falling down
thereof is as the lighting of grasshoppers:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,18);</script>The eye marvelleth at
the beauty of the whiteness thereof, and the heart is astonished at the
raining of it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,19);</script>The hoarfrost also as
salt he poureth on the earth, and being congealed, it lieth on the top of
sharp stakes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,20);</script>When the cold north
wind bloweth, and the water is congealed into ice, it abideth upon every
gathering together of water, and clotheth the water as with a breastplate.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,21);</script>It devoureth the
mountains, and burneth the wilderness, and consumeth the grass as fire.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,22);</script>A present remedy of
all is a mist coming speedily, a dew coming after heat refresheth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,23);</script>By his counsel he
appeaseth the deep, and planteth islands therein.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,24);</script>They that sail on the
sea tell of the danger thereof; and when we hear it with our ears, we
marvel thereat.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,25);</script>For therein be
strange and wondrous works, variety of all kinds of beasts and whales
created.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,26);</script>By him the end of
them hath prosperous success, and by his word all things consist.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,27);</script>We may speak much,
and yet come short: wherefore in sum, he is all.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,28);</script>How shall we be able
to magnify him? for he is great above all his works.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,29);</script>The Lord is terrible
and very great, and marvellous is his power.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,30);</script>When ye glorify the
Lord, exalt him as much as ye can; for even yet will he far exceed: and
when ye exalt him, put forth all your strength, and be not weary; for ye
can never go far enough.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,31);</script>Who hath seen him,
that he might tell us? and who can magnify him as he is?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,32);</script>There are yet hid
greater things than these be, for we have seen but a few of his works.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,33);</script>For the Lord hath
made all things; and to the godly hath he given wisdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,1);</script>Let us now praise
famous men, and our fathers that begat us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,2);</script>The Lord hath wrought
great glory by them through his great power from the beginning.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,3);</script>Such as did bear rule
in their kingdoms, men renowned for their power, giving counsel by their
understanding, and declaring prophecies:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,4);</script>Leaders of the people
by their counsels, and by their knowledge of learning meet for the people,
wise and eloquent are their instructions:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,5);</script>Such as found out
musical tunes, and recited verses in writing:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,6);</script>Rich men furnished
with ability, living peaceably in their habitations:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,7);</script>All these were
honoured in their generations, and were the glory of their times.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,8);</script>There be of them, that
have left a name behind them, that their praises might be reported.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,9);</script>And some there be,
which have no memorial; who are perished, as though they had never been;
and are become as though they had never been born; and their children
after them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,10);</script>But these were
merciful men, whose righteousness hath not been forgotten.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,11);</script>With their seed shall
continually remain a good inheritance, and their children are within the
covenant.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,12);</script>Their seed standeth
fast, and their children for their sakes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,13);</script>Their seed shall
remain for ever, and their glory shall not be blotted out.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,14);</script>Their bodies are
buried in peace; but their name liveth for evermore.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,15);</script>The people will tell
of their wisdom, and the congregation will shew forth their praise.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,16);</script>Enoch pleased the
Lord, and was translated, being an example of repentance to all
generations.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,17);</script>Noah was found
perfect and righteous; in the time of wrath he was taken in exchange
<I>for the world;</I> therefore was he left as a remnant unto the earth,
when the flood came.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,18);</script>An everlasting
covenant was made with him, that all flesh should perish no more by the
flood.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,19);</script>Abraham was a great
father of many people: in glory was there none like unto him;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,20);</script>Who kept the law of
the most High, and was in covenant with him: he established the covenant
in his flesh; and when he was proved, he was found faithful.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,21);</script>Therefore he assured
him by an oath, that he would bless the nations in his seed, and that he
would multiply him as the dust of the earth, and exalt his seed as the
stars, and cause them to inherit from sea to sea, and from the river unto
the utmost part of the land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,22);</script>With Isaac did he
establish likewise <I>for Abraham his father’s sake</I> the blessing of
all men, and the covenant, And made it rest upon the head of Jacob. He
acknowledged him in his blessing, and gave him an heritage, and divided
his portions; among the twelve tribes did he part them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,1);</script>And he brought out of
him a merciful man, which found favour in the sight of all flesh, even
Moses, beloved of God and men, whose memorial is blessed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,2);</script>He made him like to
the glorious saints, and magnified him, so that his enemies stood in fear
of him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,3);</script>By his words he caused
the wonders to cease, and he made him glorious in the sight of kings, and
gave him a commandment for his people, and shewed him part of his glory.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,4);</script>He sanctified him in
his faithfuless and meekness, and chose him out of all men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,5);</script>He made him to hear
his voice, and brought him into the dark cloud, and gave him commandments
before his face, even the law of life and knowledge, that he might teach
Jacob his covenants, and Israel his judgments.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,6);</script>He exalted Aaron, an
holy man like unto him, even his brother, of the tribe of Levi.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,7);</script>An everlasting
covenant he made with him and gave him the priesthood among the people; he
beautified him with comely ornaments, and clothed him with a robe of glory.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,8);</script>He put upon him
perfect glory; and strengthened him with rich garments, with breeches,
with a long robe, and the ephod.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,9);</script>And he compassed him
with pomegranates, and with many golden bells round about, that as he went
there might be a sound, and a noise made that might be heard in the
temple, for a memorial to the children of his people;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,10);</script>With an holy garment,
with gold, and blue silk, and purple, the work of the embroidere, with a
breastplate of judgment, and with Urim and Thummim;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,11);</script>With twisted scarlet,
the work of the cunning workman, with precious stones graven like seals,
and set in gold, the work of the jeweller, with a writing engraved for a
memorial, after the number of the tribes of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,12);</script>He set a crown of
gold upon the mitre, wherein was engraved Holiness, an ornament of honour,
a costly work, the desires of the eyes, goodly and beautiful.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,13);</script>Before him there were
none such, neither did ever any stranger put them on, but only his
children and his children’s children perpetually.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,14);</script>Their sacrifices
shall be wholly consumed every day twice continually.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,15);</script>Moses consecrated
him, and anointed him with holy oil: this was appointed unto him by an
everlasting covenant, and to his seed, so long as the heavens should
remain, that they should minister unto him, and execute the office of the
priesthood, and bless the people in his name.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,16);</script>He chose him out of
all men living to offer sacrifices to the Lord, incense, and a sweet
savour, for a memorial, to make reconciliation for his people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,17);</script>He gave unto him his
commandments, and authority in the statutes of judgments, that he should
teach Jacob the testimonies, and inform Israel in his laws.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,18);</script>Strangers conspired
together against him, and maligned him in the wilderness, even the men
that were of Dathan’s and Abiron’s side, and the congregation of Core,
with fury and wrath.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,19);</script>This the Lord saw,
and it displeased him, and in his wrathful indignation were they consumed:
he did wonders upon them, to consume them with the fiery flame.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,20);</script>But he made Aaron
more honourable, and gave him an heritage, and divided unto him the
firstfruits of the increase; especially he prepared bread in abundance:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,21);</script>For they eat of the
sacrifices of the Lord, which he gave unto him and his seed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,22);</script>Howbeit in the land
of the people he had no inheritance, neither had he any portion among the
people: for the Lord himself is his portion and inheritance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,23);</script>The third in glory is
Phinees the son of Eleazar, because he had zeal in the fear of the Lord,
and stood up with good courage of heart: when the people were turned back,
and made reconciliation for Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,24);</script>Therefore was there a
covenant of peace made with him, that he should be the chief of the
sanctuary and of his people, and that he and his posterity should have the
dignity of the priesthood for ever:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,25);</script>According to the
covenant made with David son of Jesse, of the tribe of Juda, that the
inheritance of the king should be to his posterity alone: so the
inheritance of Aaron should also be unto his seed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,26);</script>God give you wisdom
in your heart to judge his people in righteousness, that their good things
be not abolished, and that their glory may endure for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,1);</script>Jesus the son a Nave
was valiant in the wars, and was the successor of Moses in prophecies, who
according to his name was made great for the saving of the elect of God,
and taking vengeance of the enemies that rose up against them, that he
might set Israel in their inheritance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,2);</script>How great glory gat
he, when he did lift up his hands, and stretched out his sword against the
cities!
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,3);</script>Who before him so
stood to it? for the Lord himself brought his enemies unto him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,4);</script>Did not the sun go
back by his means? and was not one day as long as two?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,5);</script>He called upon the
most high Lord, when the enemies pressed upon him on every side; and the
great Lord heard him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,6);</script>And with hailstones of
mighty power he made the battle to fall violently upon the nations, and in
the descent <I>of Beth-horon</I> he destroyed them that resisted, that the
nations might know all their strength, because he fought in the sight of
the Lord, and he followed the Mighty One.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,7);</script>In the time of Moses
also he did a work of mercy, he and Caleb the son of Jephunne, in that
they withstood the congregation, and withheld the people from sin, and
appeased the wicked murmuring.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,8);</script>And of six hundred
thousand people on foot, they two were preserved to bring them in to the
heritage, even unto the land that floweth with milk and honey.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,9);</script>The Lord gave strength
also unto Caleb, which remained with him unto his old age: so that he
entered upon the high places of the land, and his seed obtained it for an
heritage:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,10);</script>That all the children
of Israel might see that it is good to follow the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,11);</script>And concerning the
judges, every one by name, whose heart went not a whoring, nor departed
from the Lord, let their memory be blessed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,12);</script>Let their bones
flourish out of their place, and let the name of them that were honoured
be continued upon their children.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,13);</script>Samuel, the prophet
of the Lord, beloved of his Lord, established a kingdom, and anointed
princes over his people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,14);</script>By the law of the
Lord he judged the congregation, and the Lord had respect unto Jacob.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,15);</script>By his faithfulness
he was found a true prophet, and by his word he was known to be faithful
in vision.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,16);</script>He called upon the
mighty Lord, when his enemies pressed upon him on every side, when he
offered the sucking lamb.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,17);</script>And the Lord
thundered from heaven, and with a great noise made his voice to be heard.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,18);</script>And he destroyed the
rulers of the Tyrians, and all the princes cf the Philistines.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,19);</script>And before his long
sleep he made protestations in the sight of the Lord and his anointed, I
have not taken any man’s goods, so much as a shoe: and no man did accuse
him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,20);</script>And after his death
he prophesied, and shewed the king his end, and lifted up his voice from
the earth in prophecy, to blot out the wickedness of the people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,1);</script>And after him rose up
Nathan to prophesy in the time of David.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,2);</script>As is the fat taken
away from the peace offering, so was David chosen out of the children of
Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,3);</script>He played with lions
as with kids, and with bears as with lambs.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,4);</script>Slew he not a giant,
when he was yet but young? and did he not take away reproach from the
people, when he lifted up his hand with the stone in the sling, and beat
down the boasting of Goliath?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,5);</script>For he called upon the
most high Lord; and he gave him strength in his right hand to slay that
mighty warrior, and set up the horn of his people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,6);</script>So the people honoured
him with ten thousands, and praised him in the blessings of the Lord, in
that he gave him a crown of glory.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,7);</script>For he destroyed the
enemies on every side, and brought to nought the Philistines his
adversaries, and brake their horn in sunder unto this day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,8);</script>In all his works he
praised the Holy One most high with words of glory; with his whole heart
he sung songs, and loved him that made him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,9);</script>He set singers also
before the altar, that by their voices they might make sweet melody, and
daily sing praises in their songs.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,10);</script>He beautified their
feasts, and set in order the solemn times until the end, that they might
praise his holy name, and that the temple might sound from morning.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,11);</script>The Lord took away
his sins, and exalted his horn for ever: he gave him a covenant of kings,
and a throne of glory in Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,12);</script>After him rose up a
wise son, and for his sake he dwelt at large.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,13);</script>Solomon reigned in a
peaceable time, and was honoured; for God made all quiet round about him,
that he might build an house in his name, and prepare his sanctuary for
ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,14);</script>How wise wast thou in
thy youth and, as a flood, filled with understanding!
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,15);</script>Thy soul covered the
whole earth, and thou filledst it with dark parables.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,16);</script>Thy name went far
unto the islands; and for thy peace thou wast beloved.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,17);</script>The countries
marvelled at thee for thy songs, and proverbs, and parables, and
interpretations.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,18);</script>By the name of the
Lord God, which is called the Lord God of Israel, thou didst gather gold
as tin and didst multiply silver as lead.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,19);</script>Thou didst bow thy
loins unto women, and by thy body thou wast brought into subjection.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,20);</script>Thou didst stain thy
honour, and pollute thy seed: so that thou broughtest wrath upon thy
children, and wast grieved for thy folly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,21);</script>So the kingdom was
divided, and out of Ephraim ruled a rebellious kingdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,22);</script>But the Lord will
never leave off his mercy, neither shall any of his works perish, neither
will he abolish the posterity of his elect, and the seed of him that
loveth him he will not take away: wherefore he gave a remnant unto Jacob,
and out of him a root unto David.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,23);</script>Thus rested Solomon
with his fathers, and of his seed he left behind him Roboam, even the
foolishness of the people, and one that had no understanding, who turned
away the people through his counsel. There was also Jeroboam the son of
Nebat, who caused Israel to sin, and shewed Ephraim the way of sin:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,24);</script>And their sins were
multiplied exceedingly, that they were driven out of the land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,25);</script>For they sought out
all wickedness, till the vengeance came upon them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,1);</script>Then stood up Elias
the prophet as fire, and his word burned like a lamp.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,2);</script>He brought a sore
famine upon them, and by his zeal he diminished their number.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,3);</script>By the word of the
Lord he shut up the heaven, and also three times brought down fire.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,4);</script>O Elias, how wast thou
honoured in thy wondrous deeds! and who may glory like unto thee!
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,5);</script>Who didst raise up a
dead man from death, and his soul from the place of the dead, by the word
of the most High:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,6);</script>Who broughtest kings
to destruction, and honorable men from their bed:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,7);</script>Who heardest the
rebuke of the Lord in Sinai, and in Horeb the judgment of vengeance:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,8);</script>Who annointedst kings
to take revenge, and prophets to succeed after him:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,9);</script>Who was taken up in a
whirlwind of fire, and in a chariot of fiery horses:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,10);</script>Who wast ordained for
reproofs in their times, to pacify the wrath of the Lord’s judgment,
before it brake forth into fury, and to turn the heart of the father unto
the son, and to restore the tribes of Jacob.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,11);</script>Blessed are they that
saw thee, and slept in love; for we shall surely live.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,12);</script>Elias it was, who was
covered with a whirlwind: and Eliseus was filled with his spirit: whilst
he lived, he was not moved with the presence of any prince, neither could
any bring him into subjection.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,13);</script>No word could
overcome him; and after his death his body prophesied.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,14);</script>He did wonders in his
life, and at his death were his works marvellous.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,15);</script>For all this the
people repented not, neither departed they from their sins, till they were
spoiled and carried out of their land, and were scattered through all the
earth: yet there remained a small people, and a ruler in the house of
David:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,16);</script>Of whom some did that
which was pleasing to God, and some multiplied sins.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,17);</script>Ezekias fortified his
city, and brought in water into the midst thereof: he digged the hard rock
with iron, and made wells for waters.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,18);</script>In his time
Sennacherib came up, and sent Rabsaces, and lifted up his hand against
Sion, and boasted proudly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,19);</script>Then trembled their
hearts and hands, and they were in pain, as women in travail.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,20);</script>But they called upon
the Lord which is merciful, and stretched out their hands toward him: and
immediately the Holy One heard them out of heaven, and delivered them by
the ministry of Esay.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,21);</script>He smote the host of
the Assyrians, and his angel destroyed them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,22);</script>For Ezekias had done
the thing that pleased the Lord, and was strong in the ways of David his
father, as Esay the prophet, who was great and faithful in his vision, had
commanded him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,23);</script>In his time the sun
went backward, and he lengthened the king’s life.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,24);</script>He saw by an
excellent spirit what should come to pass at the last, and he comforted
them that mourned in Sion.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,25);</script>He shewed what should
come to pass for ever, and secret things or ever they came.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,1);</script>The remembrance of
Josias is like the composition of the perfume that is made by the art of
the apothecary: it is sweet as honey in all mouths, and as musick at a
banquet of wine.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,2);</script>He behaved himself
uprightly in the conversion of the people, and took away the abominations
of iniquity.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,3);</script>He directed his heart
unto the Lord, and in the time of the ungodly he established the worship
of God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,4);</script>All, except David and
Ezekias and Josias, were defective: for they forsook the law of the most
High, even the kings of Juda failed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,5);</script>Therefore he gave
their power unto others, and their glory to a strange nation.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,6);</script>They burnt the chosen
city of the sanctuary, and made the streets desolate, according to the
prophecy of Jeremias.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,7);</script>For they entreated him
evil, who nevertheless was a prophet, sanctified in his mother’s womb,
that he might root out, and afflict, and destroy; and that he might build
up also, and plant.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,8);</script>It was Ezekiel who saw
the glorious vision, which was shewed him upon the chariot of the
cherubims.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,9);</script>For he made mention of
the enemies under the figure of the rain, and directed them that went
right.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,10);</script>And of the twelve
prophets let the memorial be blessed, and let their bones flourish again
out of their place: for they comforted Jacob, and delivered them by
assured hope.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,11);</script>How shall we magnify
Zorobabel? even he was as a signet on the right hand:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,12);</script>So was Jesus the son
of Josedec: who in their time builded the house, and set up an holy temple
to the Lord, which was prepared for everlasting glory.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,13);</script>And among the elect
was Neemias, whose renown is great, who raised up for us the walls that
were fallen, and set up the gates and the bars, and raised up our ruins
again.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,14);</script>But upon the earth
was no man created like Enoch; for he was taken from the earth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,15);</script>Neither was there a
young man born like Joseph, a governor of his brethren, a stay of the
people, whose bones were regarded of the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,16);</script>Sem and Seth were in
great honour among men, and so was Adam above every living thing in
creation.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,1);</script>Simon the high priest,
the son of Onias, who in his life repaired the house again, and in his
days fortified the temple:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,2);</script>And by him was built
from the foundation the double height, the high fortress of the wall about
the temple:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,3);</script>In his days the
cistern to receive water, being in compass as the sea, was covered with
plates of brass:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,4);</script>He took care of the
temple that it should not fall, and fortified the city against besieging:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,5);</script>How was he honoured in
the midst of the people in his coming out of the sanctuary!
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,6);</script>He was as the morning
star in the midst of a cloud, and as the moon at the full:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,7);</script>As the sun shining
upon the temple of the most High, and as the rainbow giving light in the
bright clouds:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,8);</script>And as the flower of
roses in the spring of the year, as lilies by the rivers of waters, and as
the branches of the frankincense tree in the time of summer:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,9);</script>As fire and incense in
the censer, and as a vessel of beaten gold set with all manner of precious
stones:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,10);</script>And as a fair olive
tree budding forth fruit, and as a cypress tree which groweth up to the
clouds.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,11);</script>When he put on the
robe of honour, and was clothed with the perfection of glory, when he went
up to the holy altar, he made the garment of holiness honourable.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,12);</script>When he took the
portions out of the priests’ hands, he himself stood by the hearth of
the altar, compassed about, as a young cedar in Libanus; and as palm trees
compassed they him round about.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,13);</script>So were all the sons
of Aaron in their glory, and the oblations of the Lord in their hands,
before all the congregation of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,14);</script>And finishing the
service at the altar, that he might adorn the offering of the most high
Almighty,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,15);</script>He stretched out his
hand to the cup, and poured of the blood of the grape, he poured out at
the foot of the altar a sweetsmelling savour unto the most high King of
all.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,16);</script>Then shouted the sons
of Aaron, and sounded the silver trumpets, and made a great noise to be
heard, for a remembrance before the most High.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,17);</script>Then all the people
together hasted, and fell down to the earth upon their faces to worship
their Lord God Almighty, the most High.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,18);</script>The singers also sang
praises with their voices, with great variety of sounds was there made
sweet melody.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,19);</script>And the people
besought the Lord, the most High, by prayer before him that is merciful,
till the solemnity of the Lord was ended, and they had finished his
service.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,20);</script>Then he went down,
and lifted up his hands over the whole congregation of the children of
Israel, to give the blessing of the Lord with his lips, and to rejoice in
his name.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,21);</script>And they bowed
themselves down to worship the second time, that they might receive a
blessing from the most High.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,22);</script>Now therefore bless
ye the God of all, which only doeth wondrous things every where, which
exalteth our days from the womb, and dealeth with us according to his
mercy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,23);</script>He grant us
joyfulness of heart, and that peace may be in our days in Israel for ever:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,24);</script>That he would confirm
his mercy with us, and deliver us at his time!
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,25);</script>There be two manner
of nations which my heart abhorreth, and the third is no nation:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,26);</script>They that sit upon
the mountain of Samaria, and they that dwell among the Philistines, and
that foolish people that dwell in Sichem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,27);</script>Jesus the son of
Sirach of Jerusalem hath written in this book the instruction of
understanding and knowledge, who out of his heart poured forth wisdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,28);</script>Blessed is he that
shall be exercised in these things; and he that layeth them up in his
heart shall become wise.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,29);</script>For if he do them, he
shall be strong to all things: for the light of the Lord leadeth him, who
giveth wisdom to the godly. Blessed be the name of the Lord for ever.
Amen, Amen.
<p>A Prayer of Jesus the son of Sirach.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,1);</script>I will thank thee, O
Lord and King, and praise thee, O God my Saviour: I do give praise unto
thy name:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,2);</script>For thou art my
defender and helper, and has preserved my body from destruction, and from
the snare of the slanderous tongue, and from the lips that forge lies, and
has been mine helper against mine adversaries:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,3);</script>And hast delivered me,
according to the multitude of they mercies and greatness of thy name, from
the teeth of them that were ready to devour me, and out of the hands of
such as sought after my life, and from the manifold afflictions which I
had;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,4);</script>From the choking of
fire on every side, and from the midst of the fire which I kindled not;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,5);</script>From the depth of the
belly of hell, from an unclean tongue, and from lying words.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,6);</script>By an accusation to
the king from an unrighteous tongue my soul drew near even unto death, my
life was near to the hell beneath.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,7);</script>They compassed me on
every side, and there was no man to help me: I looked for the succour of
men, but there was none.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,8);</script>Then thought I upon
thy mercy, O Lord, and upon thy acts of old, how thou deliverest such as
wait for thee, and savest them out of the hands of the enemies.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,9);</script>Then lifted I up my
supplications from the earth, and prayed for deliverance from death.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,10);</script>I called upon the
Lord, the Father of my Lord, that he would not leave me in the days of my
trouble, and in the time of the proud, when there was no help.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,11);</script>I will praise thy
name continually, and will sing praises with thanksgiving; and so my
prayer was heard:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,12);</script>For thou savedst me
from destruction, and deliveredst me from the evil time: therefore will I
give thanks, and praise thee, and bless they name, O Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,13);</script>When I was yet young,
or ever I went abroad, I desired wisdom openly in my prayer.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,14);</script>I prayed for her
before the temple, and will seek her out even to the end.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,15);</script>Even from the flower
till the grape was ripe hath my heart delighted in her: my foot went the
right way, from my youth up sought I after her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,16);</script>I bowed down mine ear
a little, and received her, and gat much learning.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,17);</script>I profited therein,
therefore will I ascribe glory unto him that giveth me wisdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,18);</script>For I purposed to do
after her, and earnestly I followed that which is good; so shall I not be
confounded.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,19);</script>My soul hath wrestled
with her, and in my doings I was exact: I stretched forth my hands to the
heaven above, and bewailed my ignorances of her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,20);</script>I directed my soul
unto her, and I found her in pureness: I have had my heart joined with her
from the beginning, therefore shall I not be foresaken.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,21);</script>My heart was troubled
in seeking her: therefore have I gotten a good possession.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,22);</script>The Lord hath given
me a tongue for my reward, and I will praise him therewith.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,23);</script>Draw near unto me, ye
unlearned, and dwell in the house of learning.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,24);</script>Wherefore are ye
slow, and what say ye to these things, seeing your souls are very thirsty?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,25);</script>I opened my mouth,
and said, Buy her for yourselves without money.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,26);</script>Put your neck under
the yoke, and let your soul receive instruction: she is hard at hand to
find.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,27);</script>Behold with your
eyes, how that I have but little labour, and have gotten unto me much rest.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,28);</script>Get learning with a
great sum of money, and get much gold by her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,29);</script>Let your soul rejoice
in his mercy, and be not ashamed of his praise.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,30);</script>Work your work
betimes, and in his time he will give you your reward.
