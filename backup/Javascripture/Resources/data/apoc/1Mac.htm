The First Book of the Maccabees
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>And it happened, after
that Alexander son of Philip, the Macedonian, who came out of the land of
Chettiim, had smitten Darius king of the Persians and Medes, that he
reigned in his stead, the first over Greece,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>And made many wars, and
won many strong holds, and slew the kings of the earth,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>And went through to the
ends of the earth, and took spoils of many nations, insomuch that the
earth was quiet before him; whereupon he was exalted and his heart was
lifted up.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>And he gathered a
mighty strong host and ruled over countries, and nations, and kings, who
became tributaries unto him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>And after these things
he fell sick, and perceived that he should die.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>Wherefore he called his
servants, such as were honourable, and had been brought up with him from
his youth, and parted his kingdom among them, while he was yet alive.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>So Alexander reigned
twelves years, and then died.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>And his servants bare
rule every one in his place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>And after his death
they all put crowns upon themselves; so did their sons after them many
years: and evils were multiplied in the earth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>And there came out of
them a wicked root Antiochus surnamed Epiphanes, son of Antiochus the
king, who had been an hostage at Rome, and he reigned in the hundred and
thirty and seventh year of the kingdom of the Greeks.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>In those days went
there out of Israel wicked men, who persuaded many, saying, Let us go and
make a covenant with the heathen that are round about us: for since we
departed from them we have had much sorrow.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>So this device pleased
them well.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>Then certain of the
people were so forward herein, that they went to the king, who gave them
licence to do after the ordinances of the heathen:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>Whereupon they built a
place of exercise at Jerusalem according to the customs of the heathen:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>And made themselves
uncircumcised, and forsook the holy covenant, and joined themselves to the
heathen, and were sold to do mischief.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>Now when the kingdom
was established before Antiochus, he thought to reign over Egypt that he
might have the dominion of two realms.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>Wherefore he entered
into Egypt with a great multitude, with chariots, and elephants, and
horsemen, and a great navy,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>And made war against
Ptolemee king of Egypt: but Ptolemee was afraid of him, and fled; and many
were wounded to death.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>Thus they got the
strong cities in the land of Egypt and he took the spoils thereof.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>And after that
Antiochus had smitten Egypt, he returned again in the hundred forty and
third year, and went up against Israel and Jerusalem with a great
multitude,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>And entered proudly
into the sanctuary, and took away the golden altar, and the candlestick of
light, and all the vessels thereof,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>And the table of the
shewbread, and the pouring vessels, and the vials. and the censers of
gold, and the veil, and the crown, and the golden ornaments that were
before the temple, all which he pulled off.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,23);</script>He took also the
silver and the gold, and the precious vessels: also he took the hidden
treasures which he found.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,24);</script>And when he had taken
all away, he went into his own land, having made a great massacre, and
spoken very proudly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,25);</script>Therefore there was a
great mourning in Israel, in every place where they were;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,26);</script>So that the princes
and elders mourned, the virgins and young men were made feeble, and the
beauty of women was changed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,27);</script>Every bridegroom took
up lamentation, and she that sat in the marriage chamber was in heaviness,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,28);</script>The land also was
moved for the inhabitants thereof, and all the house of Jacob was covered
with confusion.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,29);</script>And after two years
fully expired the king sent his chief collector of tribute unto the cities
of Juda, who came unto Jerusalem with a great multitude,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,30);</script>And spake peaceable
words unto them, but all was deceit: for when they had given him credence,
he fell suddenly upon the city, and smote it very sore, and destroyed much
people of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,31);</script>And when he had taken
the spoils of the city, he set it on fire, and pulled down the houses and
walls thereof on every side.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,32);</script>But the women and
children took they captive, and possessed the cattle.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,33);</script>Then builded they the
city of David with a great and strong wall, and with mighty towers, and
made it a strong hold for them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,34);</script>And they put therein a
sinful nation, wicked men, and fortified themselves therein.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,35);</script>They stored it also
with armour and victuals, and when they had gathered together the spoils
of Jerusalem, they laid them up there, and so they became a sore snare:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,36);</script>For it was a place to
lie in wait against the sanctuary, and an evil adversary to Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,37);</script>Thus they shed
innocent blood on every side of the sanctuary, and defiled it:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,38);</script>Insomuch that the
inhabitants of Jerusalem fled because of them: whereupon the city was made
an habitation of strangers, and became strange to those that were born in
her; and her own children left her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,39);</script>Her sanctuary was laid
waste like a wilderness, her feasts were turned into mourning, her
sabbaths into reproach her honour into contempt.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,40);</script>As had been her glory,
so was her dishonour increased, and her excellency was turned into
mourning.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,41);</script>Moreover king
Antiochus wrote to his whole kingdom, that all should be one people,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,42);</script>And every one should
leave his laws: so all the heathen agreed according to the commandment of
the king.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,43);</script>Yea, many also of the
Israelites consented to his religion, and sacrificed unto idols, and
profaned the sabbath.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,44);</script>For the king had sent
letters by messengers unto Jerusalem and the cities of Juda that they
should follow the strange laws of the land,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,45);</script>And forbid burnt
offerings, and sacrifice, and drink offerings, in the temple; and that
they should profane the sabbaths and festival days:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,46);</script>And pollute the
sanctuary and holy people:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,47);</script>Set up altars, and
groves, and chapels of idols, and sacrifice swine’s flesh, and unclean
beasts:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,48);</script>That they should also
leave their children uncircumcised, and make their souls abominable with
all manner of uncleanness and profanation:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,49);</script>To the end they might
forget the law, and change all the ordinances.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,50);</script>And whosoever would
not do according to the commandment of the king, he said, he should die.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,51);</script>In the selfsame manner
wrote he to his whole kingdom, and appointed overseers over all the
people, commanding the cities of Juda to sacrifice, city by city.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,52);</script>Then many of the
people were gathered unto them, to wit every one that forsook the law; and
so they committed evils in the land;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,53);</script>And drove the
Israelites into secret places, even wheresoever they could flee for
succour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,54);</script>Now the fifteenth day
of the month Casleu, in the hundred forty and fifth year, they set up the
abomination of desolation upon the altar, and builded idol altars
throughout the cities of Juda on every side;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,55);</script>And burnt incense at
the doors of their houses, and in the streets.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,56);</script>And when they had rent
in pieces the books of the law which they found, they burnt them with fire.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,57);</script>And whosoever was
found with any the book of the testament, or if any committed to the law,
the king’s commandment was, that they should put him to death.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,58);</script>Thus did they by their
authority unto the Israelites every month, to as many as were found in the
cities.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,59);</script>Now the five and
twentieth day of the month they did sacrifice upon the idol altar, which
was upon the altar of God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,60);</script>At which time
according to the commandment they put to death certain women, that had
caused their children to be circumcised.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,61);</script>And they hanged the
infants about their necks, and rifled their houses, and slew them that had
circumcised them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,62);</script>Howbeit many in Israel
were fully resolved and confirmed in themselves not to eat any unclean
thing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,63);</script>Wherefore the rather
to die, that they might not be defiled with meats, and that they might not
profane the holy covenant: so then they died.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,64);</script>And there was very
great wrath upon Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>In those days arose
Mattathias the son of John, the son of Simeon, a priest of the sons of
Joarib, from Jerusalem, and dwelt in Modin.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>And he had five sons,
Joannan, called Caddis:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>Simon; called Thassi:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>Judas, who was called
Maccabeus:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>Eleazar, called Avaran:
and Jonathan, whose surname was Apphus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>And when he saw the
blasphemies that were committed in Juda and Jerusalem,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>He said, Woe is me!
wherefore was I born to see this misery of my people, and of the holy
city, and to dwell there, when it was delivered into the hand of the
enemy, and the sanctuary into the hand of strangers?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>Her temple is become as
a man without glory.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>Her glorious vessels
are carried away into captivity, her infants are slain in the streets, her
young men with the sword of the enemy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>What nation hath not
had a part in her kingdom and gotten of her spoils?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>All her ornaments are
taken away; of a free woman she is become a bondslave.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>And, behold, our
sanctuary, even our beauty and our glory, is laid waste, and the Gentiles
have profaned it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>To what end therefore
shall we live any longer?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>Then Mattathias and
his sons rent their clothes, and put on sackcloth, and mourned very sore.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>In the mean while the
king’s officers, such as compelled the people to revolt, came into the
city Modin, to make them sacrifice.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>And when many of
Israel came unto them, Mattathias also and his sons came together.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>Then answered the
king’s officers, and said to Mattathias on this wise, Thou art a ruler,
and an honourable and great man in this city, and strengthened with sons
and brethren:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>Now therefore come
thou first, and fulfil the king’s commandment, like as all the heathen
have done, yea, and the men of Juda also, and such as remain at Jerusalem:
so shalt thou and thy house be in the number of the king’s friends, and
thou and thy children shall be honoured with silver and gold, and many
rewards.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,19);</script>Then Mattathias
answered and spake with a loud voice, Though all the nations that are
under the king’s dominion obey him, and fall away every one from the
religion of their fathers, and give consent to his commandments:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,20);</script>Yet will I and my sons
and my brethren walk in the covenant of our fathers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,21);</script>God forbid that we
should forsake the law and the ordinances.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,22);</script>We will not hearken to
the king’s words, to go from our religion, either on the right hand, or
the left.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,23);</script>Now when he had left
speaking these words, there came one of the Jews in the sight of all to
sacrifice on the altar which was at Modin, according to the king’s
commandment.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,24);</script>Which thing when
Mattathias saw, he was inflamed with zeal, and his reins trembled, neither
could he forbear to shew his anger according to judgment: wherefore he
ran, and slew him upon the altar.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,25);</script>Also the king’s
commissioner, who compelled men to sacrifice, he killed at that time, and
the altar he pulled down.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,26);</script>Thus dealt he
zealously for the law of God like as Phinees did unto Zambri the son of
Salom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,27);</script>And Mattathias cried
throughout the city with a loud voice, saying, Whosoever is zealous of the
law, and maintaineth the covenant, let him follow me.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,28);</script>So he and his sons
fled into the mountains, and left all that ever they had in the city.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,29);</script>Then many that sought
after justice and judgment went down into the wilderness, to dwell there:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,30);</script>Both they, and their
children, and their wives; and their cattle; because afflictions increased
sore upon them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,31);</script>Now when it was told
the king’s servants, and the host that was at Jerusalem, in the city of
David, that certain men, who had broken the king’s commandment, were
gone down into the secret places in the wilderness,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,32);</script>They pursued after
them a great number, and having overtaken them, they camped against them,
and made war against them on the sabbath day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,33);</script>And they said unto
them, Let that which ye have done hitherto suffice; come forth, and do
according to the commandment of the king, and ye shall live.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,34);</script>But they said, We will
not come forth, neither will we do the king’s commandment, to profane
the sabbath day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,35);</script>So then they gave them
the battle with all speed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,36);</script>Howbeit they answered
them not, neither cast they a stone at them, nor stopped the places where
they lay hid;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,37);</script>But said, Let us die
all in our innocency: heaven and earth will testify for us, that ye put us
to death wrongfully.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,38);</script>So they rose up
against them in battle on the sabbath, and they slew them, with their
wives and children and their cattle, to the number of a thousand people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,39);</script>Now when Mattathias
and his friends understood hereof, they mourned for them right sore.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,40);</script>And one of them said
to another, If we all do as our brethren have done, and fight not for our
lives and laws against the heathen, they will now quickly root us out of
the earth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,41);</script>At that time therefore
they decreed, saying, Whosoever shall come to make battle with us on the
sabbath day, we will fight against him; neither will we die all, as our
brethren that were murdered im the secret places.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,42);</script>Then came there unto
him a company of Assideans who were mighty men of Israel, even all such as
were voluntarily devoted unto the law.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,43);</script>Also all they that
fled for persecution joined themselves unto them, and were a stay unto
them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,44);</script>So they joined their
forces, and smote sinful men in their anger, and wicked men in their
wrath: but the rest fled to the heathen for succour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,45);</script>Then Mattathias and
his friends went round about, and pulled down the altars:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,46);</script>And what children
soever they found within the coast of Israel uncircumcised, those they
circumcised valiantly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,47);</script>They pursued also
after the proud men, and the work prospered in their hand.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,48);</script>So they recovered the
law out of the hand of the Gentiles, and out of the hand of kings, neither
suffered they the sinner to triumph.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,49);</script>Now when the time drew
near that Mattathias should die, he said unto his sons, Now hath pride and
rebuke gotten strength, and the time of destruction, and the wrath of
indignation:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,50);</script>Now therefore, my
sons, be ye zealous for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of
your fathers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,51);</script>Call to remembrance
what acts our fathers did in their time; so shall ye receive great honour
and an everlasting name.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,52);</script>Was not Abraham found
faithful in temptation, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,53);</script>Joseph in the time of
his distress kept the commandment and was made lord of Egypt.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,54);</script>Phinees our father in
being zealous and fervent obtained the covenant of an everlasting
priesthood.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,55);</script>Jesus for fulfilling
the word was made a judge in Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,56);</script>Caleb for bearing
witness before the congregation received the heritage of the land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,57);</script>David for being
merciful possessed the throne of an everlasting kingdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,58);</script>Elias for being
zealous and fervent for the law was taken up into heaven.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,59);</script>Ananias, Azarias, and
Misael, by believing were saved out of the flame.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,60);</script>Daniel for his
innocency was delivered from the mouth of lions.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,61);</script>And thus consider ye
throughout all ages, that none that put their trust in him shall be
overcome.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,62);</script>Fear not then the
words of a sinful man: for his glory shall be dung and worms.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,63);</script>To day he shall be
lifted up and to morrow he shall not be found, because he is returned into
his dust, and his thought is come to nothing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,64);</script>Wherefore, ye my sons,
be valiant and shew yourselves men in the behalf of the law; for by it
shall ye obtain glory.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,65);</script>And behold, I know
that your brother Simon is a man of counsel, give ear unto him alway: he
shall be a father unto you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,66);</script>As for Judas
Maccabeus, he hath been mighty and strong, even from his youth up: let him
be your captain, and fight the battle of the people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,67);</script>Take also unto you all
those that observe the law, and avenge ye the wrong of your people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,68);</script>Recompense fully the
heathen, and take heed to the commandments of the law.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,69);</script>So he blessed them,
and was gathered to his fathers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,70);</script>And he died in the
hundred forty and sixth year, and his sons buried him in the sepulchres of
his fathers at Modin, and all Israel made great lamentation for him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>Then his son Judas,
called Maccabeus, rose up in his stead.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>And all his brethren
helped him, and so did all they that held with his father, and they fought
with cheerfulness the battle of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>So he gat his people
great honour, and put on a breastplate as a giant, and girt his warlike
harness about him, and he made battles, protecting the host with his sword.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>In his acts he was like
a lion, and like a lion’s whelp roaring for his prey.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>For He pursued the
wicked, and sought them out, and burnt up those that vexed his people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>Wherefore the wicked
shrunk for fear of him, and all the workers of iniquity were troubled,
because salvation prospered in his hand.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>He grieved also many
kings, and made Jacob glad with his acts, and his memorial is blessed for
ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>Moreover he went
through the cities of Juda, destroying the ungodly out of them, and
turning away wrath from Israel:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>So that he was renowned
unto the utmost part of the earth, and he received unto him such as were
ready to perish.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>Then Apollonius
gathered the Gentiles together, and a great host out of Samaria, to fight
against Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>Which thing when Judas
perceived, he went forth to meet him, and so he smote him, and slew him:
many also fell down slain, but the rest fled.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>Wherefore Judas took
their spoils, and Apollonius’ sword also, and therewith he fought all
his life long.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>Now when Seron, a
prince of the army of Syria, heard say that Judas had gathered unto him a
multitude and company of the faithful to go out with him to war;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>He said, I will get me
a name and honour in the kingdom; for I will go fight with Judas and them
that are with him, who despise the king’s commandment.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>So he made him ready
to go up, and there went with him a mighty host of the ungodly to help
him, and to be avenged of the children of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>And when he came near
to the going up of Bethhoron, Judas went forth to meet him with a small
company:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>Who, when they saw the
host coming to meet them, said unto Judas, How shall we be able, being so
few, to fight against so great a multitude and so strong, seeing we are
ready to faint with fasting all this day?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,18);</script>Unto whom Judas
answered, It is no hard matter for many to be shut up in the hands of a
few; and with the God of heaven it is all one, to deliver with a great
multitude, or a small company:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,19);</script>For the victory of
battle standeth not in the multitude of an host; but strength cometh from
heaven.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,20);</script>They come against us
in much pride and iniquity to destroy us, and our wives and children, and
to spoil us:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,21);</script>But we fight for our
lives and our laws.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,22);</script>Wherefore the Lord
himself will overthrow them before our face: and as for you, be ye not
afraid of them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,23);</script>Now as soon as he had
left off speaking, he leapt suddenly upon them, and so Seron and his host
was overthrown before him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,24);</script>And they pursued them
from the going down of Bethhoron unto the plain, where were slain about
eight hundred men of them; and the residue fled into the land of the
Philistines.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,25);</script>Then began the fear of
Judas and his brethren, and an exceeding great dread, to fall upon the
nations round about them:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,26);</script>Insomuch as his fame
came unto the king, and all nations talked of the battles of Judas.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,27);</script>Now when king
Antiochus heard these things, he was full of indignation: wherefore he
sent and gathered together all the forces of his realm, even a very strong
army.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,28);</script>He opened also his
treasure, and gave his soldiers pay for a year, commanding them to be
ready whensoever he should need them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,29);</script>Nevertheless, when he
saw that the money of his treasures failed and that the tributes in the
country were small, because of the dissension and plague, which he had
brought upon the land in taking away the laws which had been of old time;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,30);</script>He feared that he
should not be able to bear the charges any longer, nor to have such gifts
to give so liberally as he did before: for he had abounded above the kings
that were before him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,31);</script>Wherefore, being
greatly perplexed in his mind, he determined to go into Persia, there to
take the tributes of the countries, and to gather much money.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,32);</script>So he left Lysias, a
nobleman, and one of the blood royal, to oversee the affairs of the king
from the river Euphrates unto the borders of Egypt:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,33);</script>And to bring up his
son Antiochus, until he came again.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,34);</script>Moreover he delivered
unto him the half of his forces, and the elephants, and gave him charge of
all things that he would have done, as also concerning them that dwelt in
Juda and Jerusalem:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,35);</script>To wit, that he should
send an army against them, to destroy and root out the strength of Israel,
and the remnant of Jerusalem, and to take away their memorial from that
place;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,36);</script>And that he should
place strangers in all their quarters, and divide their land by lot.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,37);</script>So the king took the
half of the forces that remained, and departed from Antioch, his royal
city, the hundred forty and seventh year; and having passed the river
Euphrates, he went through the high countries.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,38);</script>Then Lysias chose
Ptolemee the son of Dorymenes, Nicanor, and Gorgias, mighty men of the
king’s friends:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,39);</script>And with them he sent
forty thousand footmen, and seven thousand horsemen, to go into the land
of Juda, and to destroy it, as the king commanded.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,40);</script>So they went forth
with all their power, and came and pitched by Emmaus in the plain country.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,41);</script>And the merchants of
the country, hearing the fame of them, took silver and gold very much,
with servants, and came into the camp to buy the children of Israel for
slaves: a power also of Syria and of the land of the Philistines joined
themselves unto them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,42);</script>Now when Judas and his
brethren saw that miseries were multiplied, and that the forces did encamp
themselves in their borders: for they knew how the king had given
commandment to destroy the people, and utterly abolish them;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,43);</script>They said one to
another, Let us restore the decayed fortune of our people, and let us
fight for our people and the sanctuary.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,44);</script>Then was the
congregation gathered together, that they might be ready for battle, and
that they might pray, and ask mercy and compassion.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,45);</script>Now Jerusalem lay void
as a wilderness, there was none of her children that went in or out: the
sanctuary also was trodden down, and aliens kept the strong hold; the
heathen had their habitation in that place; and joy was taken from Jacob,
and the pipe with the harp ceased.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,46);</script>Wherefore the
Israelites assembled themselves together, and came to Maspha, over against
Jerusalem; for in Maspha was the place where they prayed aforetime in
Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,47);</script>Then they fasted that
day, and put on sackcloth, and cast ashes upon their heads, and rent their
clothes,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,48);</script>And laid open the book
of the law, wherein the heathen had sought to paint the likeness of their
images.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,49);</script>They brought also the
priests’ garments, and the firstfruits, and the tithes: and the
Nazarites they stirred up, who had accomplished their days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,50);</script>Then cried they with a
loud voice toward heaven, saying, What shall we do with these, and whither
shall we carry them away?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,51);</script>For thy sanctuary is
trodden down and profaned, and thy priests are in heaviness, and brought
low.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,52);</script>And lo, the heathen
are assembled together against us to destroy us: what things they imagine
against us, thou knowest.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,53);</script>How shall we be able
to stand against them, except thou, O God, be our help?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,54);</script>Then sounded they with
trumpets, and cried with a loud voice.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,55);</script>And after this Judas
ordained captains over the people, even captains over thousands, and over
hundreds, and over fifties, and over tens.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,56);</script>But as for such as
were building houses, or had betrothed wives, or were planting vineyards,
or were fearful, those he commanded that they should return, every man to
his own house, according to the law.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,57);</script>So the camp removed,
and pitched upon the south side of Emmaus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,58);</script>And Judas said, arm
yourselves, and be valiant men, and see that ye be in readiness against
the morning, that ye may fight with these nations, that are assembled
together against us to destroy us and our sanctuary:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,59);</script>For it is better for
us to die in battle, than to behold the calamities of our people and our
sanctuary.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,60);</script>Nevertheless, as the
will of God is in heaven, so let him do.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>Then took Gorgias five
thousand footmen, and a thousand of the best horsemen, and removed out of
the camp by night;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>To the end he might
rush in upon the camp of the Jews, and smite them suddenly. And the men of
the fortress were his guides.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script>Now when Judas heard
thereof he himself removed, and the valiant men with him, that he might
smite the king’s army which was at Emmaus,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,4);</script>While as yet the forces
were dispersed from the camp.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,5);</script>In the mean season came
Gorgias by night into the camp of Judas: and when he found no man there,
he sought them in the mountains: for said he, These fellows flee from us
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,6);</script>But as soon as it was
day, Judas shewed himself in the plain with three thousand men, who
nevertheless had neither armour nor swords to their minds.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,7);</script>And they saw the camp
of the heathen, that it was strong and well harnessed, and compassed round
about with horsemen; and these were expert of war.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,8);</script>Then said Judas to the
men that were with him, Fear ye not their multitude, neither be ye afraid
of their assault.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>Remember how our
fathers were delivered in the Red sea, when Pharaoh pursued them with an
army.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>Now therefore let us
cry unto heaven, if peradventure the Lord will have mercy upon us, and
remember the covenant of our fathers, and destroy this host before our
face this day:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>That so all the
heathen may know that there is one who delivereth and saveth Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,12);</script>Then the strangers
lifted up their eyes, and saw them coming over against them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,13);</script>Wherefore they went
out of the camp to battle; but they that were with Judas sounded their
trumpets.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,14);</script>So they joined battle,
and the heathen being discomfited fled into the plain.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,15);</script>Howbeit all the
hindmost of them were slain with the sword: for they pursued them unto
Gazera, and unto the plains of Idumea, and Azotus, and Jamnia, so that
there were slain of them upon a three thousand men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,16);</script>This done, Judas
returned again with his host from pursuing them,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,17);</script>And said to the
people, Be not greedy of the spoil inasmuch as there is a battle before us,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,18);</script>And Gorgias and his
host are here by us in the mountain: but stand ye now against our enemies,
and overcome them, and after this ye may boldly take the spoils.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,19);</script>As Judas was yet
speaking these words, there appeared a part of them looking out of the
mountain:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,20);</script>Who when they
perceived that the Jews had put their host to flight and were burning the
tents; for the smoke that was seen declared what was done:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>When therefore they
perceived these things, they were sore afraid, and seeing also the host of
Judas in the plain ready to fight,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,22);</script>They fled every one
into the land of strangers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,23);</script>Then Judas returned to
spoil the tents, where they got much gold, and silver, and blue silk, and
purple of the sea, and great riches.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,24);</script>After this they went
home, and sung a song of thanksgiving, and praised the Lord in heaven:
because it is good, because his mercy endureth forever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,25);</script>Thus Israel had a
great deliverance that day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,26);</script>Now all the strangers
that had escaped came and told Lysias what had happened:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,27);</script>Who, when he heard
thereof, was confounded and discouraged, because neither such things as he
would were done unto Israel, nor such things as the king commanded him
were come to pass.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,28);</script>The next year
therefore following Lysias gathered together threescore thousand choice
men of foot, and five thousand horsemen, that he might subdue them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,29);</script>So they came into
Idumea, and pitched their tents at Bethsura, and Judas met them with ten
thousand men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,30);</script>And when he saw that
mighty army, he prayed and said, Blessed art thou, O Saviour of Israel,
who didst quell the violence of the mighty man by the hand of thy servant
David, and gavest the host of strangers into the hands of Jonathan the son
of Saul, and his armourbearer;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,31);</script>Shut up this army in
the hand of thy people Israel, and let them be confounded in their power
and horsemen:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,32);</script>Make them to be of no
courage, and cause the boldness of their strength to fall away, and let
them quake at their destruction:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,33);</script>Cast them down with
the sword of them that love thee, and let all those that know thy name
praise thee with thanksgiving.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,34);</script>So they joined battle;
and there were slain of the host of Lysias about five thousand men, even
before them were they slain.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,35);</script>Now when Lysias saw
his army put to flight, and the manliness of Judas’ soldiers, and how
they were ready either to live or die valiantly, he went into Antiochia,
and gathered together a company of strangers, and having made his army
greater than it was, he purposed to come again into Judea.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,36);</script>Then said Judas and
his brethren, Behold, our enemies are discomfited: let us go up to cleanse
and dedicate the sanctuary.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,37);</script>Upon this all the host
assembled themselves together, and went up into mount Sion.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,38);</script>And when they saw the
sanctuary desolate, and the altar profaned, and the gates burned up, and
shrubs growing in the courts as in a forest, or in one of the mountains,
yea, and the priests’ chambers pulled down;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,39);</script>They rent their
clothes, and made great lamentation, and cast ashes upon their heads,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,40);</script>And fell down flat to
the ground upon their faces, and blew an alarm with the trumpets, and
cried toward heaven.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,41);</script>Then Judas appointed
certain men to fight against those that were in the fortress, until he had
cleansed the sanctuary.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,42);</script>So he chose priests of
blameless conversation, such as had pleasure in the law:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,43);</script>Who cleansed the
sanctuary, and bare out the defiled stones into an unclean place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,44);</script>And when as they
consulted what to do with the altar of burnt offerings, which was profaned;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,45);</script>They thought it best
to pull it down, lest it should be a reproach to them, because the heathen
had defiled it: wherefore they pulled it down,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,46);</script>And laid up the stones
in the mountain of the temple in a convenient place, until there should
come a prophet to shew what should be done with them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,47);</script>Then they took whole
stones according to the law, and built a new altar according to the former;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,48);</script>And made up the
sanctuary, and the things that were within the temple, and hallowed the
courts.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,49);</script>They made also new
holy vessels, and into the temple they brought the candlestick, and the
altar of burnt offerings, and of incense, and the table.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,50);</script>And upon the altar
they burned incense, and the lamps that were upon the candlestick they
lighted, that they might give light in the temple.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,51);</script>Furthermore they set
the loaves upon the table, and spread out the veils, and finished all the
works which they had begun to make.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,52);</script>Now on the five and
twentieth day of the ninth month, which is called the month Casleu, in the
hundred forty and eighth year, they rose up betimes in the morning,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,53);</script>And offered sacrifice
according to the law upon the new altar of burnt offerings, which they had
made.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,54);</script>Look, at what time and
what day the heathen had profaned it, even in that was it dedicated with
songs, and citherns, and harps, and cymbals.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,55);</script>Then all the people
fell upon their faces, worshipping and praising the God of heaven, who had
given them good success.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,56);</script>And so they kept the
dedication of the altar eight days and offered burnt offerings with
gladness, and sacrificed the sacrifice of deliverance and praise.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,57);</script>They decked also the
forefront of the temple with crowns of gold, and with shields; and the
gates and the chambers they renewed, and hanged doors upon them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,58);</script>Thus was there very
great gladness among the people, for that the reproach of the heathen was
put away.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,59);</script>Moreover Judas and his
brethren with the whole congregation of Israel ordained, that the days of
the dedication of the altar should be kept in their season from year to
year by the space of eight days, from the five and twentieth day of the
month Casleu, with mirth and gladness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,60);</script>At that time also they
builded up the mount Sion with high walls and strong towers round about,
lest the Gentiles should come and tread it down as they had done before.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,61);</script>And they set there a
garrison to keep it, and fortified Bethsura to preserve it; that the
people might have a defence against Idumea.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>Now when the nations
round about heard that the altar was built and the sanctuary renewed as
before, it displeased them very much.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>Wherefore they thought
to destroy the generation of Jacob that was among them, and thereupon they
began to slay and destroy the people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>Then Judas fought
against the children of Esau in Idumea at Arabattine, because they
besieged Gael: and he gave them a great overthrow, and abated their
courage, and took their spoils.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>Also he remembered the
injury of the children of Bean, who had been a snare and an offence unto
the people, in that they lay in wait for them in the ways.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>He shut them up
therefore in the towers, and encamped against them, and destroyed them
utterly, and burned the towers of that place with fire, and all that were
therein.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>Afterward he passed
over to the children of Ammon, where he found a mighty power, and much
people, with Timotheus their captain.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>So he fought many
battles with them, till at length they were discomfited before him; and he
smote them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>And when he had taken
Jazar, with the towns belonging thereto, he returned into Judea.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>Then the heathen that
were at Galaad assembled themselves together against the Israelites that
were in their quarters, to destroy them; but they fled to the fortress of
Dathema.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>And sent letters unto
Judas and his brethren, The heathen that are round about us are assembled
together against us to destroy us:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>And they are preparing
to come and take the fortress whereunto we are fled, Timotheus being
captain of their host.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>Come now therefore,
and deliver us from their hands, for many of us are slain:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,13);</script>Yea, all our brethren
that were in the places of Tobie are put to death: their wives and their
children also they have carried away captives, and borne away their stuff;
and they have destroyed there about a thousand men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,14);</script>While these letters
were yet reading, behold, there came other messengers from Galilee with
their clothes rent, who reported on this wise,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,15);</script>And said, They of
Ptolemais, and of Tyrus, and Sidon, and all Galilee of the Gentiles, are
assembled together against us to consume us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,16);</script>Now when Judas and the
people heard these words, there assembled a great congregation together,
to consult what they should do for their brethren, that were in trouble,
and assaulted of them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,17);</script>Then said Judas unto
Simon his brother, Choose thee out men, and go and deliver thy brethren
that are in Galilee, for I and Jonathan my brother will go into the
country of Galaad.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,18);</script>So he left Joseph the
son of Zacharias, and Azarias, captains of the people, with the remnant of
the host in Judea to keep it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,19);</script>Unto whom he gave
commandment, saying, Take ye the charge of this people, and see that ye
make not war against the heathen until the time that we come again.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,20);</script>Now unto Simon were
given three thousand men to go into Galilee, and unto Judas eight thousand
men for the country of Galaad.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,21);</script>Then went Simon into
Galilee, where he fought many battles with the heathen, so that the
heathen were discomfited by him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,22);</script>And he pursued them
unto the gate of Ptolemais; and there were slain of the heathen about
three thousand men, whose spoils he took.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,23);</script>And those that were in
Galilee, and in Arbattis, with their wives and their children, and all
that they had, took he away with him, and brought them into Judea with
great joy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,24);</script>Judas Maccabeus also
and his brother Jonathan went over Jordan, and travelled three days’
journey in the wilderness,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,25);</script>Where they met with
the Nabathites, who came unto them in a peaceable manner, and told them
every thing that had happened to their brethren in the land of Galaad:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,26);</script>And how that many of
them were shut up in Bosora, and Bosor, and Alema, Casphor, Maked, and
Carnaim; all these cities are strong and great:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,27);</script>And that they were
shut up in the rest of the cities of the country of Galaad, and that
against to morrow they had appointed to bring their host against the
forts, and to take them, and to destroy them all in one day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,28);</script>Hereupon Judas and his
host turned suddenly by the way of the wilderness unto Bosora; and when he
had won the city, he slew all the males with the edge of the sword, and
took all their spoils, and burned the city with fire,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,29);</script>From whence he removed
by night, and went till he came to the fortress.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,30);</script>And betimes in the
morning they looked up, and, behold, there was an innumerable people
bearing ladders and other engines of war, to take the fortress: for they
assaulted them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,31);</script>When Judas therefore
saw that the battle was begun, and that the cry of the city went up to
heaven, with trumpets, and a great sound,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,32);</script>He said unto his host,
Fight this day for your brethren.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,33);</script>So he went forth
behind them in three companies, who sounded their trumpets, and cried with
prayer.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,34);</script>Then the host of
Timotheus, knowing that it was Maccabeus, fled from him: wherefore he
smote them with a great slaughter; so that there were killed of them that
day about eight thousand men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,35);</script>This done, Judas
turned aside to Maspha; and after he had assaulted it he took and slew all
the males therein, and received the spoils thereof and and burnt it with
fire.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,36);</script>From thence went he,
and took Casphon, Maged, Bosor, and the other cities of the country of
Galaad.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,37);</script>After these things
gathered Timotheus another host and encamped against Raphon beyond the
brook.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,38);</script>So Judas sent men to
espy the host, who brought him word, saying, All the heathen that be round
about us are assembled unto them, even a very great host.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,39);</script>He hath also hired the
Arabians to help them and they have pitched their tents beyond the brook,
ready to come and fight against thee. Upon this Judas went to meet them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,40);</script>Then Timotheus said
unto the captains of his host, When Judas and his host come near the
brook, if he pass over first unto us, we shall not be able to withstand
him; for he will mightily prevail against us:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,41);</script>But if he be afraid,
and camp beyond the river, we shall go over unto him, and prevail against
him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,42);</script>Now when Judas came
near the brook, he caused the scribes of the people to remain by the
brook: unto whom he gave commandment, saying, Suffer no man to remain in
the camp, but let all come to the battle.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,43);</script>So he went first over
unto them, and all the people after him: then all the heathen, being
discomfited before him, cast away their weapons, and fled unto the temple
that was at Carnaim.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,44);</script>But they took the
city, and burned the temple with all that were therein. Thus was Carnaim
subdued, neither could they stand any longer before Judas.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,45);</script>Then Judas gathered
together all the Israelites that were in the country of Galaad, from the
least unto the greatest, even their wives, and their children, and their
stuff, a very great host, to the end they might come into the land of
Judea.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,46);</script>Now when they came
unto Ephron, (this was a great city in the way as they should go, very
well fortified) they could not turn from it, either on the right hand or
the left, but must needs pass through the midst of it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,47);</script>Then they of the city
shut them out, and stopped up the gates with stones.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,48);</script>Whereupon Judas sent
unto them in peaceable manner, saying, Let us pass through your land to go
into our own country, and none shall do you any hurt; we will only pass
through on foot: howbeit they would not open unto him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,49);</script>Wherefore Judas
commanded a proclamation to be made throughout the host, that every man
should pitch his tent in the place where he was.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,50);</script>So the soldiers
pitched, and assaulted the city all that day and all that night, till at
the length the city was delivered into his hands:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,51);</script>Who then slew all the
males with the edge of the sword, and rased the city, and took the spoils
thereof, and passed through the city over them that were slain.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,52);</script>After this went they
over Jordan into the great plain before Bethsan.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,53);</script>And Judas gathered
together those that came behind, and exhorted the people all the way
through, till they came into the land of Judea.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,54);</script>So they went up to
mount Sion with joy and gladness, where they offered burnt offerings,
because not one of them were slain until they had returned in peace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,55);</script>Now what time as Judas
and Jonathan were in the land of Galaad, and Simon his brother in Galilee
before Ptolemais,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,56);</script>Joseph the son of
Zacharias, and Azarias, captains of the garrisons, heard of the valiant
acts and warlike deeds which they had done.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,57);</script>Wherefore they said,
Let us also get us a name, and go fight against the heathen that are round
about us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,58);</script>So when they had given
charge unto the garrison that was with them, they went toward Jamnia.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,59);</script>Then came Gorgias and
his men out of the city to fight against them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,60);</script>And so it was, that
Joseph and Azaras were put to flight, and pursued unto the borders of
Judea: and there were slain that day of the people of Israel about two
thousand men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,61);</script>Thus was there a great
overthrow among the children of Israel, because they were not obedient
unto Judas and his brethren, but thought to do some valiant act.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,62);</script>Moreover these men
came not of the seed of those, by whose hand deliverance was given unto
Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,63);</script>Howbeit the man Judas
and his brethren were greatly renowned in the sight of all Israel, and of
all the heathen, wheresoever their name was heard of;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,64);</script>Insomuch as the the
people assembled unto them with joyful acclamations.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,65);</script>Afterward went Judas
forth with his brethren, and fought against the children of Esau in the
land toward the south, where he smote Hebron, and the towns thereof, and
pulled down the fortress of it, and burned the towers thereof round about.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,66);</script>From thence he removed
to go into the land of the Philistines, and passed through Samaria.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,67);</script>At that time certain
priests, desirous to shew their valour, were slain in battle, for that
they went out to fight unadvisedly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,68);</script>So Judas turned to
Azotus in the land of the Philistines, and when he had pulled down their
altars, and burned their carved images with fire, and spoiled their
cities, he returned into the land of Judea.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>About that time king
Antiochus travelling through the high countries heard say, that Elymais in
the country of Persia was a city greatly renowned for riches, silver, and
gold;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>And that there was in
it a very rich temple, wherein were coverings of gold, and breastplates,
and shields, which Alexander, son of Philip, the Macedonian king, who
reigned first among the Grecians, had left there.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>Wherefore he came and
sought to take the city, and to spoil it; but he was not able, because
they of the city, having had warning thereof,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,4);</script>Rose up against him in
battle: so he fled, and departed thence with great heaviness, and returned
to Babylon.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>Moreover there came one
who brought him tidings into Persia, that the armies, which went against
the land of Judea, were put to flight:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>And that Lysias, who
went forth first with a great power was driven away of the Jews; and that
they were made strong by the armour, and power, and store of spoils, which
they had gotten of the armies, whom they had destroyed:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>Also that they had
pulled down the abomination, which he had set up upon the altar in
Jerusalem, and that they had compassed about the sanctuary with high
walls, as before, and his city Bethsura.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>Now when the king heard
these words, he was astonished and sore moved: whereupon he laid him down
upon his bed, and fell sick for grief, because it had not befallen him as
he looked for.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>And there he continued
many days: for his grief was ever more and more, and he made account that
he should die.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>Wherefore he called
for all his friends, and said unto them, The sleep is gone from mine eyes,
and my heart faileth for very care.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,11);</script>And I thought with
myself, Into what tribulation am I come, and how great a flood of misery
is it, wherein now I am! for I was bountiful and beloved in my power.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>But now I remember the
evils that I did at Jerusalem, and that I took all the vessels of gold and
silver that were therein, and sent to destroy the inhabitants of Judea
without a cause.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>I perceive therefore
that for this cause these troubles are come upon me, and, behold, I perish
through great grief in a strange land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>Then called he for
Philip, one of his friends, who he made ruler over all his realm,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>And gave him the
crown, and his robe, and his signet, to the end he should bring up his son
Antiochus, and nourish him up for the kingdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,16);</script>So king Antiochus died
there in the hundred forty and ninth year.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,17);</script>Now when Lysias knew
that the king was dead, he set up Antiochus his son, whom he had brought
up being young, to reign in his stead, and his name he called Eupator.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,18);</script>About this time they
that were in the tower shut up the Israelites round about the sanctuary,
and sought always their hurt, and the strengthening of the heathen.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,19);</script>Wherefore Judas,
purposing to destroy them, called all the people together to besiege them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,20);</script>So they came together,
and besieged them in the hundred and fiftieth year, and he made mounts for
shot against them, and other engines.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,21);</script>Howbeit certain of
them that were besieged got forth, unto whom some ungodly men of Israel
joined themselves:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,22);</script>And they went unto the
king, and said, How long will it be ere thou execute judgment, and avenge
our brethren?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,23);</script>We have been willing
to serve thy father, and to do as he would have us, and to obey his
commandments;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,24);</script>For which cause they
of our nation besiege the tower, and are alienated from us: moreover as
many of us as they could light on they slew, and spoiled our inheritance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,25);</script>Neither have they
stretched out their hand against us only, but also against their borders.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,26);</script>And, behold, this day
are they besieging the tower at Jerusalem, to take it: the sanctuary also
and Bethsura have they fortified.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,27);</script>Wherefore if thou dost
not prevent them quickly, they will do the greater things than these,
neither shalt thou be able to rule them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,28);</script>Now when the king
heard this, he was angry, and gathered together all his friends, and the
captains of his army, and those that had charge of the horse.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,29);</script>There came also unto
him from other kingdoms, and from isles of the sea, bands of hired
soldiers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,30);</script>So that the number of
his army was an hundred thousand footmen, and twenty thousand horsemen,
and two and thirty elephants exercised in battle.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,31);</script>These went through
Idumea, and pitched against Bethsura, which they assaulted many days,
making engines of war; but they of Bethsura came out, and burned them with
fire, and fought valiantly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,32);</script>Upon this Judas
removed from the tower, and pitched in Bathzacharias, over against the
king’s camp.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,33);</script>Then the king rising
very early marched fiercely with his host toward Bathzacharias, where his
armies made them ready to battle, and sounded the trumpets.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,34);</script>And to the end they
might provoke the elephants to fight, they shewed them the blood of grapes
and mulberries.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,35);</script>Moreover they divided
the beasts among the armies, and for every elephant they appointed a
thousand men, armed with coats of mail, and with helmets of brass on their
heads; and beside this, for every beast were ordained five hundred
horsemen of the best.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,36);</script>These were ready at
every occasion: wheresoever the beast was, and whithersoever the beast
went, they went also, neither departed they from him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,37);</script>And upon the beasts
were there strong towers of wood, which covered every one of them, and
were girt fast unto them with devices: there were also upon every one two
and thirty strong men, that fought upon them, beside the Indian that ruled
him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,38);</script>As for the remnant of
the horsemen, they set them on this side and that side at the two parts of
the host giving them signs what to do, and being harnessed all over amidst
the ranks.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,39);</script>Now when the sun shone
upon the shields of gold and brass, the mountains glistered therewith, and
shined like lamps of fire.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,40);</script>So part of the
king’s army being spread upon the high mountains, and part on the
valleys below, they marched on safely and in order.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,41);</script>Wherefore all that
heard the noise of their multitude, and the marching of the company, and
the rattling of the harness, were moved: for the army was very great and
mighty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,42);</script>Then Judas and his
host drew near, and entered into battle, and there were slain of the
king’s army six hundred men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,43);</script>Eleazar also, surnamed
Savaran, perceiving that one of the beasts, armed with royal harness, was
higher than all the rest, and supposing that the king was upon him,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,44);</script>Put himself in
jeopardy, to the end he might deliver his people, and get him a perpetual
name:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,45);</script>Wherefore he ran upon
him courageously through the midst of the battle, slaying on the right
hand and on the left, so that they were divided from him on both sides.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,46);</script>Which done, he crept
under the elephant, and thrust him under, and slew him: whereupon the
elephant fell down upon him, and there he died.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,47);</script>Howbeit the rest of
the Jews seeing the strength of the king, and the violence of his forces,
turned away from them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,48);</script>Then the king’s army
went up to Jerusalem to meet them, and the king pitched his tents against
Judea, and against mount Sion.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,49);</script>But with them that
were in Bethsura he made peace: for they came out of the city, because
they had no victuals there to endure the siege, it being a year of rest to
the land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,50);</script>So the king took
Bethsura, and set a garrison there to keep it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,51);</script>As for the sanctuary,
he besieged it many days: and set there artillery with engines and
instruments to cast fire and stones, and pieces to cast darts and slings.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,52);</script>Whereupon they also
made engines against their engines, and held them battle a long season.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,53);</script>Yet at the last, their
vessels being without victuals, (for that it was the seventh year, and
they in Judea that were delivered from the Gentiles, had eaten up the
residue of the store;)
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,54);</script>There were but a few
left in the sanctuary, because the famine did so prevail against them,
that they were fain to disperse themselves, every man to his own place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,55);</script>At that time Lysias
heard say, that Philip, whom Antiochus the king, whiles he lived, had
appointed to bring up his son Antiochus, that he might be king,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,56);</script>Was returned out of
Persia and Media, and the king’s host also that went with him, and that
he sought to take unto him the ruling of the affairs.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,57);</script>Wherefore he went in
all haste, and said to the king and the captains of the host and the
company, We decay daily, and our victuals are but small, and the place we
lay siege unto is strong, and the affairs of the kingdom lie upon us:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,58);</script>Now therefore let us
be friends with these men, and make peace with them, and with all their
nation;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,59);</script>And covenant with
them, that they shall live after their laws, as they did before: for they
are therefore displeased, and have done all these things, because we
abolished their laws.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,60);</script>So the king and the
princes were content: wherefore he sent unto them to make peace; and they
accepted thereof.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,61);</script>Also the king and the
princes made an oath unto them: whereupon they went out of the strong hold.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,62);</script>Then the king entered
into mount Sion; but when he saw the strength of the place, he broke his
oath that he had made, and gave commandment to pull down the wall round
about.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,63);</script>Afterward departed he
in all haste, and returned unto Antiochia, where he found Philip to be
master of the city: so he fought against him, and took the city by force.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,1);</script>In the hundred and one
and fiftieth year Demetrius the son of Seleucus departed from Rome, and
came up with a few men unto a city of the sea coast, and reigned there.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,2);</script>And as he entered into
the palace of his ancestors, so it was, that his forces had taken
Antiochus and Lysias, to bring them unto him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,3);</script>Wherefore, when he knew
it, he said, Let me not see their faces.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,4);</script>So his host slew them.
Now when Demetrius was set upon the throne of his kingdom,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,5);</script>There came unto him all
the wicked and ungodly men of Israel, having Alcimus, who was desirous to
be high priest, for their captain:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,6);</script>And they accused the
people to the king, saying, Judas and his brethren have slain all thy
friends, and driven us out of our own land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,7);</script>Now therefore send some
man whom thou trustest, and let him go and see what havock he hath made
among us, and in the king’s land, and let him punish them with all them
that aid them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,8);</script>Then the king chose
Bacchides, a friend of the king, who ruled beyond the flood, and was a
great man in the kingdom, and faithful to the king,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,9);</script>And him he sent with
that wicked Alcimus, whom he made high priest, and commanded that he
should take vengeance of the children of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,10);</script>So they departed, and
came with a great power into the land of Judea, where they sent messengers
to Judas and his brethren with peaceable words deceitfully.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,11);</script>But they gave no heed
to their words; for they saw that they were come with a great power.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,12);</script>Then did there
assemble unto Alcimus and Bacchides a company of scribes, to require
justice.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,13);</script>Now the Assideans were
the first among the children of Israel that sought peace of them:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,14);</script>For said they, One
that is a priest of the seed of Aaron is come with this army, and he will
do us no wrong.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,15);</script>So he spake unto them,
peaceably, and sware unto them, saying, we will procure the harm neither
of you nor your friends.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,16);</script>Whereupon they
believed him: howbeit he took of them threescore men, and slew them in one
day, according to the words which he wrote,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,17);</script>The flesh of thy
saints have they cast out, and their blood have they shed round about
Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,18);</script>Wherefore the fear and
dread of them fell upon all the people, who said, There is neither truth
nor righteousness in them; for they have broken the covenant and oath that
they made.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,19);</script>After this, removed
Bacchides from Jerusalem, and pitched his tents in Bezeth, where he sent
and took many of the men that had forsaken him, and certain of the people
also, and when he had slain them, he cast them into the great pit.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,20);</script>Then committed he the
country to Alcimus, and left with him a power to aid him: so Bacchides
went to the king.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,21);</script>But Alcimus contended
for the high priesthood.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,22);</script>And unto him resorted
all such as troubled the people, who, after they had gotten the land of
Juda into their power, did much hurt in Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,23);</script>Now when Judas saw all
the mischief that Alcimus and his company had done among the Israelites,
even above the heathen,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,24);</script>He went out into all
the coasts of Judea round about, and took vengeance of them that had
revolted from him, so that they durst no more go forth into the country.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,25);</script>On the other side,
when Alcimus saw that Judas and his company had gotten the upper hand, and
knew that he was not able to abide their force, he went again to the king,
and said all the worst of them that he could.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,26);</script>Then the king sent
Nicanor, one of his honourable princes, a man that bare deadly hate unto
Israel, with commandment to destroy the people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,27);</script>So Nicanor came to
Jerusalem with a great force; and sent unto Judas and his brethren
deceitfully with friendly words, saying,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,28);</script>Let there be no battle
between me and you; I will come with a few men, that I may see you in
peace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,29);</script>He came therefore to
Judas, and they saluted one another peaceably. Howbeit the enemies were
prepared to take away Judas by violence.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,30);</script>Which thing after it
was known to Judas, to wit, that he came unto him with deceit, he was sore
afraid of him, and would see his face no more.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,31);</script>Nicanor also, when he
saw that his counsel was discovered, went out to fight against Judas
beside Capharsalama:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,32);</script>Where there were slain
of Nicanor’s side about five thousand men, and the rest fled into the
city of David.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,33);</script>After this went
Nicanor up to mount Sion, and there came out of the sanctuary certain of
the priests and certain of the elders of the people, to salute him
peaceably, and to shew him the burnt sacrifice that was offered for the
king.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,34);</script>But he mocked them,
and laughed at them, and abused them shamefully, and spake proudly,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,35);</script>And sware in his
wrath, saying, Unless Judas and his host be now delivered into my hands,
if ever I come again in safety, I will burn up this house: and with that
he went out in a great rage.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,36);</script>Then the priests
entered in, and stood before the altar and the temple, weeping, and saying,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,37);</script>Thou, O Lord, didst
choose this house to be called by thy name, and to be a house of prayer
and petition for thy people:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,38);</script>Be avenged of this man
and his host, and let them fall by the sword: remember their blasphemies,
and suffer them not to continue any longer.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,39);</script>So Nicanor went out of
Jerusalem, and pitched his tents in Bethhoron, where an host out of Syria
met him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,40);</script>But Judas pitched in
Adasa with three thousand men, and there he prayed, saying,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,41);</script>O Lord, when they that
were sent from the king of the Assyrians blasphemed, thine angel went out,
and smote an hundred fourscore and five thousand of them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,42);</script>Even so destroy thou
this host before us this day, that the rest may know that he hath spoken
blasphemously against thy sanctuary, and judge thou him according to his
wickedness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,43);</script>So the thirteenth day
of the month Adar the hosts joined battle: but Nicanor’s host was
discomfited, and he himself was first slain in the battle.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,44);</script>Now when Nicanor’s
host saw that he was slain, they cast away their weapons, and fled.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,45);</script>Then they pursued
after them a day’s journey, from Adasa unto Gazera, sounding an alarm
after them with their trumpets.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,46);</script>Whereupon they came
forth out of all the towns of Judea round about, and closed them in; so
that they, turning back upon them that pursued them, were all slain with
the sword, and not one of them was left.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,47);</script>Afterwards they took
the spoils, and the prey, and smote off Nicanors head, and his right hand,
which he stretched out so proudly, and brought them away, and hanged them
up toward Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,48);</script>For this cause the
people rejoiced greatly, and they kept that day a day of great gladness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,49);</script>Moreover they ordained
to keep yearly this day, being the thirteenth of Adar.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,50);</script>Thus the land of Juda
was in rest a little while.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,1);</script>Now Judas had heard of
the the Romans, that they were mighty and valiant men, and such as would
lovingly accept all that joined themselves unto them, and make a league of
amity with all that came unto them;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,2);</script>And that they were men
of great valour. It was told him also of their wars and noble acts which
they had done among the Galatians, and how they had conquered them, and
brought them under tribute;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,3);</script>And what they had done
in the country of Spain, for the winning of the mines of the silver and
gold which is there;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,4);</script>And that by their
policy and patience they had conquered all the place, though it were very
far from them; and the kings also that came against them from the
uttermost part of the earth, till they had discomfited them, and given
them a great overthrow, so that the rest did give them tribute every year:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script>Beside this, how they
had discomfited in battle Philip, and Perseus, king of the Citims, with
others that lifted up themselves against them, and had overcome them:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,6);</script>How also Antiochus the
great king of Asia, that came against them in battle, having an hundred
and twenty elephants, with horsemen, and chariots, and a very great army,
was discomfited by them;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,7);</script>And how they took him
alive, and covenanted that he and such as reigned after him should pay a
great tribute, and give hostages, and that which was agreed upon,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,8);</script>And the country of
India, and Media and Lydia and of the goodliest countries, which they took
of him, and gave to king Eumenes:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,9);</script>Moreover how the
Grecians had determined to come and destroy them;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>And that they, having
knowledge thereof sent against them a certain captain, and fighting with
them slew many of them, and carried away captives their wives and their
children, and spoiled them, and took possession of their lands, and pulled
down their strong holds, and brought them to be their servants unto this
day:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,11);</script>It was told him
besides, how they destroyed and brought under their dominion all other
kingdoms and isles that at any time resisted them;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,12);</script>But with their friends
and such as relied upon them they kept amity: and that they had conquered
kingdoms both far and nigh, insomuch as all that heard of their name were
afraid of them:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,13);</script>Also that, whom they
would help to a kingdom, those reign; and whom again they would, they
displace: finally, that they were greatly exalted:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,14);</script>Yet for all this none
of them wore a crown or was clothed in purple, to be magnified thereby:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,15);</script>Moreover how they had
made for themselves a senate house, wherein three hundred and twenty men
sat in council daily, consulting alway for the people, to the end they
might be well ordered:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,16);</script>And that they
committed their government to one man every year, who ruled over all their
country, and that all were obedient to that one, and that there was
neither envy nor emmulation among them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,17);</script>In consideration of
these things, Judas chose Eupolemus the son of John, the son of Accos, and
Jason the son of Eleazar, and sent them to Rome, to make a league of amity
and confederacy with them,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,18);</script>And to intreat them
that they would take the yoke from them; for they saw that the kingdom of
the Grecians did oppress Israel with servitude.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,19);</script>They went therefore to
Rome, which was a very great journey, and came into the senate, where they
spake and said.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,20);</script>Judas Maccabeus with
his brethren, and the people of the Jews, have sent us unto you, to make a
confederacy and peace with you, and that we might be registered your
confederates and friends.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,21);</script>So that matter pleased
the Romans well.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,22);</script>And this is the copy
of the epistle which the senate wrote back again in tables of brass, and
sent to Jerusalem, that there they might have by them a memorial of peace
and confederacy:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,23);</script>Good success be to the
Romans, and to the people of the Jews, by sea and by land for ever: the
sword also and enemy be far from them,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,24);</script>If there come first
any war upon the Romans or any of their confederates throughout all their
dominion,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,25);</script>The people of the Jews
shall help them, as the time shall be appointed, with all their heart:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,26);</script>Neither shall they
give any thing unto them that make war upon them, or aid them with
victuals, weapons, money, or ships, as it hath seemed good unto the
Romans; but they shall keep their covenants without taking any thing
therefore.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,27);</script>In the same manner
also, if war come first upon the nation of the Jews, the Romans shall help
them with all their heart, according as the time shall be appointed them:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,28);</script>Neither shall victuals
be given to them that take part against them, or weapons, or money, or
ships, as it hath seemed good to the Romans; but they shall keep their
covenants, and that without deceit.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,29);</script>According to these
articles did the Romans make a covenant with the people of the Jews.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,30);</script>Howbeit if hereafter
the one party or the other shall think to meet to add or diminish any
thing, they may do it at their pleasures, and whatsoever they shall add or
take away shall be ratified.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,31);</script>And as touching the
evils that Demetrius doeth to the Jews, we have written unto him, saying,
Wherefore thou made thy yoke heavy upon our friends and confederates the
Jews?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,32);</script>If therefore they
complain any more against thee, we will do them justice, and fight with
thee by sea and by land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>Furthermore, when
Demetrius heard the Nicanor and his host were slain in battle, he sent
Bacchides and Alcimus into the land of Judea the second time, and with
them the chief strength of his host:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>Who went forth by the
way that leadeth to Galgala, and pitched their tents before Masaloth,
which is in Arbela, and after they had won it, they slew much people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>Also the first month of
the hundred fifty and second year they encamped before Jerusalem:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,4);</script>From whence they
removed, and went to Berea, with twenty thousand footmen and two thousand
horsemen.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,5);</script>Now Judas had pitched
his tents at Eleasa, and three thousand chosen men with him:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,6);</script>Who seeing the
multitude of the other army to he so great were sore afraid; whereupon
many conveyed themselves out of the host, insomuch as abode of them no
more but eight hundred men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,7);</script>When Judas therefore
saw that his host slipt away, and that the battle pressed upon him, he was
sore troubled in mind, and much distressed, for that he had no time to
gather them together.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,8);</script>Nevertheless unto them
that remained he said, Let us arise and go up against our enemies, if
peradventure we may be able to fight with them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,9);</script>But they dehorted him,
saying, We shall never be able: let us now rather save our lives, and
hereafter we will return with our brethren, and fight against them: for we
are but few.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>Then Judas said, God
forbid that I should do this thing, and flee away from them: if our time
be come, let us die manfully for our brethren, and let us not stain our
honour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>With that the host of
Bacchides removed out of their tents, and stood over against them, their
horsemen being divided into two troops, and their slingers and archers
going before the host and they that marched in the foreward were all
mighty men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,12);</script>As for Bacchides, he
was in the right wing: so the host drew near on the two parts, and sounded
their trumpets.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,13);</script>They also of Judas’
side, even they sounded their trumpets also, so that the earth shook at
the noise of the armies, and the battle continued from morning till night.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,14);</script>Now when Judas
perceived that Bacchides and the strength of his army were on the right
side, he took with him all the hardy men,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,15);</script>Who discomfited the
right wing, and pursued them unto the mount Azotus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,16);</script>But when they of the
left wing saw that they of the right wing were discomfited, they followed
upon Judas and those that were with him hard at the heels from behind:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,17);</script>Whereupon there was a
sore battle, insomuch as many were slain on both parts.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,18);</script>Judas also was killed,
and the remnant fled.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,19);</script>THen Jonathan and
Simon took Judas their brother, and buried him in the sepulchre of his
fathers in Modin.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,20);</script>Moreover they bewailed
him, and all Israel made great lamentation for him, and mourned many days,
saying,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,21);</script>How is the valiant man
fallen, that delivered Israel!
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,22);</script>As for the other
things concerning Judas and his wars, and the noble acts which he did, and
his greatness, they are not written: for they were very many.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,23);</script>Now after the death of
Judas the wicked began to put forth their heads in all the coasts of
Israel, and there arose up all such as wrought iniquity.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,24);</script>In those days also was
there a very great famine, by reason whereof the country revolted, and
went with them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,25);</script>Then Bacchides chose
the wicked men, and made them lords of the country.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,26);</script>And they made enquiry
and search for Judas’ friends, and brought them unto Bacchides, who took
vengeance of them, and used them despitefully.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,27);</script>So was there a great
affliction in Israel, the like whereof was not since the time that a
prophet was not seen among them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,28);</script>For this cause all
Judas’ friends came together, and said unto Jonathan,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,29);</script>Since thy brother
Judas died, we have no man like him to go forth against our enemies, and
Bacchides, and against them of our nation that are adversaries to us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,30);</script>Now therefore we have
chosen thee this day to be our prince and captain in his stead, that thou
mayest fight our battles.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,31);</script>Upon this Jonathan
took the governance upon him at that time, and rose up instead of his
brother Judas.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,32);</script>But when Bacchides gat
knowledge thereof, he sought for to slay him
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,33);</script>Then Jonathan, and
Simon his brother, and all that were with him, perceiving that, fled into
the wilderness of Thecoe, and pitched their tents by the water of the pool
Asphar.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,34);</script>Which when Bacchides
understood, he came near to Jordan with all his host upon the sabbath day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,35);</script>Now Jonathan had sent
his brother John, a captain of the people, to pray his friends the
Nabathites, that they might leave with them their carriage, which was much.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,36);</script>But the children of
Jambri came out of Medaba, and took John, and all that he had, and went
their way with it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,37);</script>After this came word
to Jonathan and Simon his brother, that the children of Jambri made a
great marriage, and were bringing the bride from Nadabatha with a great
train, as being the daughter of one of the great princes of Chanaan.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,38);</script>Therefore they
remembered John their brother, and went up, and hid themselves under the
covert of the mountain:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,39);</script>Where they lifted up
their eyes, and looked, and, behold, there was much ado and great
carriage: and the bridegroom came forth, and his friends and brethren, to
meet them with drums, and instruments of musick, and many weapons.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,40);</script>Then Jonathan and they
that were with him rose up against them from the place where they lay in
ambush, and made a slaughter of them in such sort, as many fell down dead,
and the remnant fled into the mountain, and they took all their spoils.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,41);</script>Thus was the marriage
turned into mourning, and the noise of their melody into lamentation.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,42);</script>So when they had
avenged fully the blood of their brother, they turned again to the marsh
of Jordan.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,43);</script>Now when Bacchides
heard hereof, he came on the sabbath day unto the banks of Jordan with a
great power.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,44);</script>Then Jonathan said to
his company, Let us go up now and fight for our lives, for it standeth not
with us to day, as in time past:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,45);</script>For, behold, the
battle is before us and behind us, and the water of Jordan on this side
and that side, the marsh likewise and wood, neither is there place for us
to turn aside.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,46);</script>Wherefore cry ye now
unto heaven, that ye may be delivered from the hand of your enemies.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,47);</script>With that they joined
battle, and Jonathan stretched forth his hand to smite Bacchides, but he
turned back from him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,48);</script>Then Jonathan and they
that were with him leapt into Jordan, and swam over unto the other bank:
howbeit the other passed not over Jordan unto them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,49);</script>So there were slain of
Bacchides’ side that day about a thousand men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,50);</script>Afterward returned
Bacchides to Jerusalem and repaired the strong cites in Judea; the fort in
Jericho, and Emmaus, and Bethhoron, and Bethel, and Thamnatha, Pharathoni,
and Taphon, these did he strengthen with high walls, with gates and with
bars.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,51);</script>And in them he set a
garrison, that they might work malice upon Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,52);</script>He fortified also the
city Bethsura, and Gazera, and the tower, and put forces in them, and
provision of victuals.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,53);</script>Besides, he took the
chief men’s sons in the country for hostages, and put them into the
tower at Jerusalem to be kept.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,54);</script>Moreover in the
hundred fifty and third year, in the second month, Alcimus commanded that
the wall of the inner court of the sanctuary should be pulled down; he
pulled down also the works of the prophets
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,55);</script>And as he began to
pull down, even at that time was Alcimus plagued, and his enterprizes
hindered: for his mouth was stopped, and he was taken with a palsy, so
that he could no more speak any thing, nor give order concerning his house.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,56);</script>So Alcimus died at
that time with great torment.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,57);</script>Now when Bacchides saw
that Alcimus was dead, he returned to the king: whereupon the land of
Judea was in rest two years.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,58);</script>Then all the ungodly
men held a council, saying, Behold, Jonathan and his company are at ease,
and dwell without care: now therefore we will bring Bacchides hither, who
shall take them all in one night.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,59);</script>So they went and
consulted with him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,60);</script>Then removed he, and
came with a great host, and sent letters privily to his adherents in
Judea, that they should take Jonathan and those that were with him:
howbeit they could not, because their counsel was known unto them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,61);</script>Wherefore they took of
the men of the country, that were authors of that mischief, about fifty
persons, and slew them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,62);</script>Afterward Jonathan,
and Simon, and they that were with him, got them away to Bethbasi, which
is in the wilderness, and they repaired the decays thereof, and made it
strong.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,63);</script>Which thing when
Bacchides knew, he gathered together all his host, and sent word to them
that were of Judea.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,64);</script>Then went he and laid
siege against Bethbasi; and they fought against it a long season and made
engines of war.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,65);</script>But Jonathan left his
brother Simon in the city, and went forth himself into the country, and
with a certain number went he forth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,66);</script>And he smote Odonarkes
and his brethren, and the children of Phasiron in their tent.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,67);</script>And when he began to
smite them, and came up with his forces, Simon and his company went out of
the city, and burned up the engines of war,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,68);</script>And fought against
Bacchides, who was discomfited by them, and they afflicted him sore: for
his counsel and travail was in vain.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,69);</script>Wherefore he was very
wroth at the wicked men that gave him counsel to come into the country,
inasmuch as he slew many of them, and purposed to return into his own
country.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,70);</script>Whereof when Jonathan
had knowledge, he sent ambassadors unto him, to the end he should make
peace with him, and deliver them the prisoners.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,71);</script>Which thing he
accepted, and did according to his demands, and sware unto him that he
would never do him harm all the days of his life.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,72);</script>When therefore he had
restored unto him the prisoners that he had taken aforetime out of the
land of Judea, he returned and went his way into his own land, neither
came he any more into their borders.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,73);</script>Thus the sword ceased
from Israel: but Jonathan dwelt at Machmas, and began to govern the
people; and he destroyed the ungodly men out of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script>In the hundred and
sixtieth year Alexander, the son of Antiochus surnamed Epiphanes, went up
and took Ptolemais: for the people had received him, by means whereof he
reigned there,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,2);</script>Now when king
Demetrius heard thereof, he gathered together an exceeding great host, and
went forth against him to fight.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,3);</script>Moreover Demetrius
sent letters unto Jonathan with loving words, so as he magnified him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,4);</script>For said he, Let us
first make peace with him, before he join with Alexander against us:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,5);</script>Else he will remember
all the evils that we have done against him, and against his brethren and
his people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,6);</script>Wherefore he gave him
authority to gather together an host, and to provide weapons, that he
might aid him in battle: he commanded also that the hostages that were in
the tower should be delivered him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,7);</script>Then came Jonathan to
Jerusalem, and read the letters in the audience of all the people, and of
them that were in the tower:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,8);</script>Who were sore afraid,
when they heard that the king had given him authority to gather together
an host.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,9);</script>Whereupon they of the
tower delivered their hostages unto Jonathan, and he delivered them unto
their parents.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,10);</script>This done, Jonathan
settled himself in Jerusalem, and began to build and repair the city.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,11);</script>And he commanded the
workmen to build the walls and the mount Sion and about with square stones
for fortification; and they did so.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,12);</script>Then the strangers,
that were in the fortresses which Bacchides had built, fled away;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,13);</script>Insomuch as every man
left his place, and went into his own country.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,14);</script>Only at Bethsura
certain of those that had forsaken the law and the commandments remained
still: for it was their place of refuge.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,15);</script>Now when king
Alexander had heard what promises Demetrius had sent unto Jonathan: when
also it was told him of the battles and noble acts which he and his
brethren had done, and of the pains that they had endured,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,16);</script>He said, Shall we
find such another man? now therefore we will make him our friend and
confederate.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,17);</script>Upon this he wrote a
letter, and sent it unto him, according to these words, saying,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,18);</script>King Alexander to his
brother Jonathan sendeth greeting:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,19);</script>We have heard of
thee, that thou art a man of great power, and meet to be our friend.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,20);</script>Wherefore now this
day we ordain thee to be the high priest of thy nation, and to be called
the king’s friend; (and therewithal he sent him a purple robe and a
crown of gold:) and require thee to take our part, and keep friendship
with us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,21);</script>So in the seventh
month of the hundred and sixtieth year, at the feast of the tabernacles,
Jonathan put on the holy robe, and gathered together forces, and provided
much armour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,22);</script>Whereof when
Demetrius heard, he was very sorry, and said,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,23);</script>What have we done,
that Alexander hath prevented us in making amity with the Jews to
strengthen himself?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,24);</script>I also will write
unto them words of encouragement, and promise them dignities and gifts,
that I may have their aid.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,25);</script>He sent unto them
therefore to this effect: King Demetrius unto the people of the Jews
sendeth greeting:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,26);</script>Whereas ye have kept
covenants with us, and continued in our friendship, not joining yourselves
with our enemies, we have heard hereof, and are glad.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,27);</script>Wherefore now
continue ye still to be faithful unto us, and we will well recompense you
for the things ye do in our behalf,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,28);</script>And will grant you
many immunities, and give you rewards.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,29);</script>And now do I free
you, and for your sake I release all the Jews, from tributes, and from the
customs of salt, and from crown taxes,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,30);</script>And from that which
appertaineth unto me to receive for the third part or the seed, and the
half of the fruit of the trees, I release it from this day forth, so that
they shall not be taken of the land of Judea, nor of the three governments
which are added thereunto out of the country of Samaria and Galilee, from
this day forth for evermore.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,31);</script>Let Jerusalem also be
holy and free, with the borders thereof, both from tenths and tributes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,32);</script>And as for the tower
which is at Jerusalem, I yield up authority over it, and give the high
priest, that he may set in it such men as he shall choose to keep it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,33);</script>Moreover I freely set
at liberty every one of the Jews, that were carried captives out of the
land of Judea into any part of my kingdom, and I will that all my officers
remit the tributes even of their cattle.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,34);</script>Furthermore I will
that all the feasts, and sabbaths, and new moons, and solemn days, and the
three days before the feast, and the three days after the feast shall be
all of immunity and freedom for all the Jews in my realm.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,35);</script>Also no man shall
have authority to meddle with or to molest any of them in any matter.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,36);</script>I will further, that
there be enrolled among the king’s forces about thirty thousand men of
the Jews, unto whom pay shall be given, as belongeth to all king’s
forces.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,37);</script>And of them some
shall be placed in the king’s strong holds, of whom also some shall be
set over the affairs of the kingdom, which are of trust: and I will that
their overseers and governors be of themselves, and that they live after
their own laws, even as the king hath commanded in the land of Judea.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,38);</script>And concerning the
three governments that are added to Judea from the country of Samaria, let
them be joined with Judea, that they may be reckoned to be under one, nor
bound to obey other authority than the high priest’s.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,39);</script>As for Ptolemais, and
the land pertaining thereto, I give it as a free gift to the sanctuary at
Jerusalem for the necessary expences of the sanctuary.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,40);</script>Moreover I give every
year fifteen thousand shekels of silver out of the king’s accounts from
the places appertaining.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,41);</script>And all the overplus,
which the officers payed not in as in former time, from henceforth shall
be given toward the works of the temple.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,42);</script>And beside this, the
five thousand shekels of silver, which they took from the uses of the
temple out of the accounts year by year, even those things shall be
released, because they appertain to the priests that minister.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,43);</script>And whosoever they be
that flee unto the temple at Jerusalem, or be within the liberties hereof,
being indebted unto the king, or for any other matter, let them be at
liberty, and all that they have in my realm.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,44);</script>For the building also
and repairing of the works of the sanctuary expences shall be given of the
king’s accounts.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,45);</script>Yea, and for the
building of the walls of Jerusalem, and the fortifying thereof round
about, expences shall be given out of the king’s accounts, as also for
the building of the walls in Judea.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,46);</script>Now when Jonathan and
the people heard these words, they gave no credit unto them, nor received
them, because they remembered the great evil that he had done in Israel;
for he had afflicted them very sore.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,47);</script>But with Alexander
they were well pleased, because he was the first that entreated of true
peace with them, and they were confederate with him always.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,48);</script>Then gathered king
Alexander great forces, and camped over against Demetrius.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,49);</script>And after the two
kings had joined battle, Demetrius’ host fled: but Alexander followed
after him, and prevailed against them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,50);</script>And he continued the
battle very sore until the sun went down: and that day was Demetrius slain.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,51);</script>Afterward Alexander
sent ambassadors to Ptolemee king of Egypt with a message to this effect:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,52);</script>Forasmuch as I am
come again to my realm, and am set in the throne of my progenitors, and
have gotten the dominion, and overthrown Demetrius, and recovered our
country;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,53);</script>For after I had
joined battle with him, both he and his host was discomfited by us, so
that we sit in the throne of his kingdom:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,54);</script>Now therefore let us
make a league of amity together, and give me now thy daughter to wife: and
I will be thy son in law, and will give both thee and her as according to
thy dignity.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,55);</script>Then Ptolemee the
king gave answer, saying, Happy be the day wherein thou didst return into
the land of thy fathers, and satest in the throne of their kingdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,56);</script>And now will I do to
thee, as thou hast written: meet me therefore at Ptolemais, that we may
see one another; for I will marry my daughter to thee according to thy
desire.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,57);</script>So Ptolemee went out
of Egypt with his daughter Cleopatra, and they came unto Ptolemais in the
hundred threescore and second year:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,58);</script>Where king Alexander
meeting him, he gave unto him his daughter Cleopatra, and celebrated her
marriage at Ptolemais with great glory, as the manner of kings is.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,59);</script>Now king Alexander
had written unto Jonathan, that he should come and meet him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,60);</script>Who thereupon went
honourably to Ptolemais, where he met the two kings, and gave them and
their friends silver and gold, and many presents, and found favour in
their sight.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,61);</script>At that time certain
pestilent fellows of Israel, men of a wicked life, assembled themselves
against him, to accuse him: but the king would not hear them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,62);</script>Yea more than that,
the king commanded to take off his garments, and clothe him in purple: and
they did so.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,63);</script>And he made him sit
by himself, and said into his princes, Go with him into the midst of the
city, and make proclamation, that no man complain against him of any
matter, and that no man trouble him for any manner of cause.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,64);</script>Now when his accusers
saw that he was honored according to the proclamation, and clothed in
purple, they fled all away.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,65);</script>So the king honoured
him, and wrote him among his chief friends, and made him a duke, and
partaker of his dominion.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,66);</script>Afterward Jonathan
returned to Jerusalem with peace and gladness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,67);</script>Furthermore in the;
hundred threescore and fifth year came Demetrius son of Demetrius out of
Crete into the land of his fathers:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,68);</script>Whereof when king
Alexander heard tell, he was right sorry, and returned into Antioch.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,69);</script>Then Demetrius made
Apollonius the governor of Celosyria his general, who gathered together a
great host, and camped in Jamnia, and sent unto Jonathan the high priest,
saying,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,70);</script>Thou alone liftest up
thyself against us, and I am laughed to scorn for thy sake, and
reproached: and why dost thou vaunt thy power against us in the mountains?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,71);</script>Now therefore, if
thou trustest in thine own strength, come down to us into the plain field,
and there let us try the matter together: for with me is the power of the
cities.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,72);</script>Ask and learn who I
am, and the rest that take our part, and they shall tell thee that thy
foot is not able to to flight in their own land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,73);</script>Wherefore now thou
shalt not be able to abide the horsemen and so great a power in the plain,
where is neither stone nor flint, nor place to flee unto.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,74);</script>So when Jonathan
heard these words of Apollonius, he was moved in his mind, and choosing
ten thousand men he went out of Jerusalem, where Simon his brother met him
for to help him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,75);</script>And he pitched his
tents against Joppa: but; they of Joppa shut him out of the city, because
Apollonius had a garrison there.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,76);</script>Then Jonathan laid
siege unto it: whereupon they of the city let him in for fear: and so
Jonathan won Joppa.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,77);</script>Whereof when
Apollonius heard, he took three thousand horsemen, with a great host of
footmen, and went to Azotus as one that journeyed, and therewithal drew
him forth into the plain. because he had a great number of horsemen, in
whom he put his trust.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,78);</script>Then Jonathan
followed after him to Azotus, where the armies joined battle.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,79);</script>Now Apollonius had
left a thousand horsemen in ambush.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,80);</script>And Jonathan knew
that there was an ambushment behind him; for they had compassed in his
host, and cast darts at the people, from morning till evening.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,81);</script>But the people stood
still, as Jonathan had commanded them: and so the enemies’ horses were
tired.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,82);</script>Then brought Simon
forth his host, and set them against the footmen, (for the horsemen were
spent) who were discomfited by him, and fled.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,83);</script>The horsemen also,
being scattered in the field, fled to Azotus, and went into Bethdagon,
their idol’s temple, for safety.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,84);</script>But Jonathan set fire
on Azotus, and the cities round about it, and took their spoils; and the
temple of Dagon, with them that were fled into it, he burned with fire.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,85);</script>Thus there were
burned and slain with the sword well nigh eight thousand men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,86);</script>And from thence
Jonathan removed his host, and camped against Ascalon, where the men of
the city came forth, and met him with great pomp.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,87);</script>After this returned
Jonathan and his host unto Jerusalem, having any spoils.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,88);</script>Now when king
ALexander heard these things, he honoured Jonathan yet more.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,89);</script>And sent him a buckle
of gold, as the use is to be given to such as are of the king’s blood:
he gave him also Accaron with the borders thereof in possession.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>And the king of Egypt
gathered together a great host, like the sand that lieth upon the sea
shore, and many ships, and went about through deceit to get Alexander’s
kingdom, and join it to his own.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>Whereupon he took his
journey into Spain in peaceable manner, so as they of the cities opened
unto him, and met him: for king Alexander had commanded them so to do,
because he was his brother in law.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,3);</script>Now as Ptolemee
entered into the cities, he set in every one of them a garrison of
soldiers to keep it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,4);</script>And when he came near
to Azotus, they shewed him the temple of Dagon that was burnt, and Azotus
and the suburbs thereof that were destroyed, and the bodies that were cast
abroad and them that he had burnt in the battle; for they had made heaps
of them by the way where he should pass.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,5);</script>Also they told the
king whatsoever Jonathan had done, to the intent he might blame him: but
the king held his peace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,6);</script>Then Jonathan met the
king with great pomp at Joppa, where they saluted one another, and lodged.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,7);</script>Afterward Jonathan,
when he had gone with the king to the river called Eleutherus, returned
again to Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,8);</script>King Ptolemee
therefore, having gotten the dominion of the cities by the sea unto
Seleucia upon the sea coast, imagined wicked counsels against Alexander.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,9);</script>Whereupon he sent
ambasadors unto king Demetrius, saying, Come, let us make a league betwixt
us, and I will give thee my daughter whom Alexander hath, and thou shalt
reign in thy father’s kingdom:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,10);</script>For I repent that I
gave my daughter unto him, for he sought to slay me.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,11);</script>Thus did he slander
him, because he was desirous of his kingdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,12);</script>Wherefore he took his
daughter from him, and gave her to Demetrius, and forsook Alexander, so
that their hatred was openly known.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,13);</script>Then Ptolemee entered
into Antioch, where he set two crowns upon his head, the crown of Asia,
and of Egypt.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,14);</script>In the mean season
was king Alexander in Cilicia, because those that dwelt in those parts had
revolted from him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,15);</script>But when Alexander
heard of this, he came to war against him: whereupon king Ptolemee brought
forth his host, and met him with a mighty power, and put him to flight.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,16);</script>So Alexander fled
into Arabia there to be defended; but king Ptolemee was exalted:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,17);</script>For Zabdiel the
Arabian took off Alexander’s head, and sent it unto Ptolemee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,18);</script>King Ptolemee also
died the third day after, and they that were in the strong holds were
slain one of another.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,19);</script>By this means
Demetrius reigned in the hundred threescore and seventh year.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,20);</script>At the same time
Jonathan gathered together them that were in Judea to take the tower that
was in Jerusalem: and he made many engines of war against it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,21);</script>Then came ungodly
persons, who hated their own people, went unto the king, and told him that
Jonathan besieged the tower,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,22);</script>Whereof when he
heard, he was angry, and immediately removing, he came to Ptolemais, and
wrote unto Jonathan, that he should not lay siege to the tower, but come
and speak with him at Ptolemais in great haste.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,23);</script>Nevertheless
Jonathan, when he heard this, commanded to besiege it still: and he chose
certain of the elders of Israel and the priests, and put himself in peril;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,24);</script>And took silver and
gold, and raiment, and divers presents besides, and went to Ptolemais unto
the king, where he found favour in his sight.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,25);</script>And though certain
ungodly men of the people had made complaints against him,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,26);</script>Yet the king
entreated him as his predecessors had done before, and promoted him in the
sight of all his friends,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,27);</script>And confirmed him in
the high priesthood, and in all the honours that he had before, and gave
him preeminence among his chief friends.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,28);</script>Then Jonathan desired
the king, that he would make Judea free from tribute, as also the three
governments, with the country of Samaria; and he promised him three
hundred talents.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,29);</script>So the king
consented, and wrote letters unto Jonathan of all these things after this
manner:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,30);</script>King Demetrius unto
his brother Jonathan, and unto the nation of the Jews, sendeth greeting:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,31);</script>We send you here a
copy of the letter which we did write unto our cousin Lasthenes concerning
you, that ye might see it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,32);</script>King Demetrius unto
his father Lasthenes sendeth greeting:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,33);</script>We are determined to
do good to the people of the Jews, who are our friends, and keep covenants
with us, because of their good will toward us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,34);</script>Wherefore we have
ratified unto them the borders of Judea, with the three governments of
Apherema and Lydda and Ramathem, that are added unto Judea from the
country of Samaria, and all things appertaining unto them, for all such as
do sacrifice in Jerusalem, instead of the payments which the king received
of them yearly aforetime out of the fruits of the earth and of trees.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,35);</script>And as for other
things that belong unto us, of the tithes and customs pertaining unto us,
as also the saltpits, and the crown taxes, which are due unto us, we
discharge them of them all for their relief.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,36);</script>And nothing hereof
shall be revoked from this time forth for ever.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,37);</script>Now therefore see
that thou make a copy of these things, and let it be delivered unto
Jonathan, and set upon the holy mount in a conspicuous place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,38);</script>After this, when king
Demetrius saw that the land was quiet before him, and that no resistance
was made against him, he sent away all his forces, every one to his own
place, except certain bands of strangers, whom he had gathered from the
isles of the heathen: wherefore all the forces of his fathers hated him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,39);</script>Moreover there was
one Tryphon, that had been of Alexander’s part afore, who, seeing that
all the host murmured against Demetrius, went to Simalcue the Arabian that
brought up Antiochus the young son of Alexander,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,40);</script>And lay sore upon him
to deliver him this young Antiochus, that he might reign in his father’s
stead: he told him therefore all that Demetrius had done, and how his men
of war were at enmity with him, and there he remained a long season.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,41);</script>In the mean time
Jonathan sent unto king Demetrius, that he would cast those of the tower
out of Jerusalem, and those also in the fortresses: for they fought
against Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,42);</script>So Demetrius sent
unto Jonathan, saying, I will not only do this for thee and thy people,
but I will greatly honour thee and thy nation, if opportunity serve.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,43);</script>Now therefore thou
shalt do well, if thou send me men to help me; for all my forces are gone
from me.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,44);</script>Upon this Jonathan
sent him three thousand strong men unto Antioch: and when they came to the
king, the king was very glad of their coming.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,45);</script>Howbeit they that
were of the city gathered themselves together into the midst of the city,
to the number of an hundred and twenty thousand men, and would have slain
the king.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,46);</script>Wherefore the king
fled into the court, but they of the city kept the passages of the city,
and began to fight.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,47);</script>Then the king called
to the Jews for help, who came unto him all at once, and dispersing
themselves through the city slew that day in the city to the number of an
hundred thousand.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,48);</script>Also they set fire on
the city, and gat many spoils that day, and delivered the king.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,49);</script>So when they of the
city saw that the Jews had got the city as they would, their courage was
abated: wherefore they made supplication to the king, and cried, saying,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,50);</script>Grant us peace, and
let the Jews cease from assaulting us and the city.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,51);</script>With that they cast
away their weapons, and made peace; and the Jews were honoured in the
sight of the king, and in the sight of all that were in his realm; and
they returned to Jerusalem, having great spoils.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,52);</script>So king Demetrius sat
on the throne of his kingdom, and the land was quiet before him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,53);</script>Nevertheless he
dissembled in all that ever he spake, and estranged himself from Jonathan,
neither rewarded he him according to the benefits which he had received of
him, but troubled him very sore.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,54);</script>After this returned
Tryphon, and with him the young child Antiochus, who reigned, and was
crowned.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,55);</script>Then there gathered
unto him all the men of war, whom Demetrius had put away, and they fought
against Demetrius, who turned his back and fled.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,56);</script>Moreover Tryphon took
the elephants, and won Antioch.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,57);</script>At that time young
Antiochus wrote unto Jonathan, saying, I confirm thee in the high
priesthood, and appoint thee ruler over the four governments, and to be
one of the king’s friends.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,58);</script>Upon this he sent him
golden vessels to be served in, and gave him leave to drink in gold, and
to be clothed in purple, and to wear a golden buckle.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,59);</script>His brother Simon
also he made captain from the place called The ladder of Tyrus unto the
borders of Egypt.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,60);</script>Then Jonathan went
forth, and passed through the cities beyond the water, and all the forces
of Syria gathered themselves unto him for to help him: and when he came to
Ascalon, they of the city met him honourably.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,61);</script>From whence he went
to Gaza, but they of Gaza shut him out; wherefore he laid siege unto it,
and burned the suburbs thereof with fire, and spoiled them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,62);</script>Afterward, when they
of Gaza made supplication unto Jonathan, he made peace with them, and took
the sons of their chief men for hostages, and sent them to Jerusalem, and
passed through the country unto Damascus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,63);</script>Now when Jonathan
heard that Demetrius’ princes were come to Cades, which is in Galilee,
with a great power, purposing to remove him out of the country,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,64);</script>He went to meet them,
and left Simon his brother in the country.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,65);</script>Then Simon encamped
against Bethsura and fought against it a long season, and shut it up:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,66);</script>But they desired to
have peace with him, which he granted them, and then put them out from
thence, and took the city, and set a garrison in it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,67);</script>As for Jonathan and
his host, they pitched at the water of Gennesar, from whence betimes in
the morning they gat them to the plain of Nasor.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,68);</script>And, behold, the host
of strangers met them in the plain, who, having laid men in ambush for him
in the mountains, came themselves over against him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,69);</script>So when they that lay
in ambush rose out of their places and joined battle, all that were of
Jonathan’s side fled;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,70);</script>Insomuch as there was
not one of them left, except Mattathias the son of Absalom, and Judas the
son of Calphi, the captains of the host.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,71);</script>Then Jonathan rent
his clothes, and cast earth upon his head, and prayed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,72);</script>Afterwards turning
again to battle, he put them to flight, and so they ran away.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,73);</script>Now when his own men
that were fled saw this, they turned again unto him, and with him pursued
them to Cades, even unto their own tents, and there they camped.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,74);</script>So there were slain
of the heathen that day about three thousand men: but Jonathan returned to
Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>Now when Jonathan saw
that time served him, he chose certain men, and sent them to Rome, for to
confirm and renew the friendship that they had with them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,2);</script>He sent letters also
to the Lacedemonians, and to other places, for the same purpose.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,3);</script>So they went unto
Rome, and entered into the senate, and said, Jonathan the high priest, and
the people of the Jews, sent us unto you, to the end ye should renew the
friendship, which ye had with them, and league, as in former time.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,4);</script>Upon this the Romans
gave them letters unto the governors of every place that they should bring
them into the land of Judea peaceably.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,5);</script>And this is the copy
of the letters which Jonathan wrote to the Lacedemonians:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,6);</script>Jonathan the high
priest, and the elders of the nation, and the priests, and the other of
the Jews, unto the Lacedemonians their brethren send greeting:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,7);</script>There were letters
sent in times past unto Onias the high priest from Darius, who reigned
then among you, to signify that ye are our brethren, as the copy here
underwritten doth specify.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,8);</script>At which time Onias
entreated the ambassador that was sent honourably, and received the
letters, wherein declaration was made of the league and friendship.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,9);</script>Therefore we also,
albeit we need none of these things, that we have the holy books of
scripture in our hands to comfort us,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,10);</script>Have nevertheless
attempted to send unto you for the renewing of brotherhood and friendship,
lest we should become strangers unto you altogether: for there is a long
time passed since ye sent unto us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,11);</script>We therefore at all
times without ceasing, both in our feasts, and other convenient days, do
remember you in the sacrifices which we offer, and in our prayers, as
reason is, and as it becometh us to think upon our brethren:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,12);</script>And we are right glad
of your honour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,13);</script>As for ourselves, we
have had great troubles and wars on every side, forsomuch as the kings
that are round about us have fought against us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,14);</script>Howbeit we would not
be troublesome unto you, nor to others of our confederates and friends, in
these wars:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,15);</script>For we have help from
heaven that succoureth us, so as we are delivered from our enemies, and
our enemies are brought under foot.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,16);</script>For this cause we
chose Numenius the son of Antiochus, and Antipater he son of Jason, and
sent them unto the Romans, to renew the amity that we had with them, and
the former league.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,17);</script>We commanded them
also to go unto you, and to salute and to deliver you our letters
concerning the renewing of our brotherhood.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,18);</script>Wherefore now ye
shall do well to give us an answer thereto.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,19);</script>And this is the copy
of the letters which Oniares sent.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,20);</script>Areus king of the
Lacedemonians to Onias the high priest, greeting:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,21);</script>It is found in
writing, that the Lacedemonians and Jews are brethren, and that they are
of the stock of Abraham:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,22);</script>Now therefore, since
this is come to our knowledge, ye shall do well to write unto us of your
prosperity.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,23);</script>We do write back
again to you, that your cattle and goods are our’s, and our’s are
your’s We do command therefore our ambassadors to make report unto you
on this wise.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,24);</script>Now when Jonathan
heard that Demebius’ princes were come to fight against him with a
greater host than afore,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,25);</script>He removed from
Jerusalem, and met them in the land of Amathis: for he gave them no
respite to enter his country.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,26);</script>He sent spies also
unto their tents, who came again, and told him that they were appointed to
come upon them in the night season.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,27);</script>Wherefore so soon as
the sun was down, Jonathan commanded his men to watch, and to be in arms,
that all the night long they might be ready to fight: also he sent forth
centinels round about the host.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,28);</script>But when the
adversaries heard that Jonathan and his men were ready for battle, they
feared, and trembled in their hearts, and they kindled fires in their camp.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,29);</script>Howbeit Jonathan and
his company knew it not till the morning: for they saw the lights burning.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,30);</script>Then Jonathan pursued
after them, but overtook them not: for they were gone over the river
Eleutherus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,31);</script>Wherefore Jonathan
turned to the Arabians, who were called Zabadeans, and smote them, and
took their spoils.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,32);</script>And removing thence,
he came to Damascus, and so passed through all the country,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,33);</script>Simon also went
forth, and passed through the country unto Ascalon, and the holds there
adjoining, from whence he turned aside to Joppa, and won it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,34);</script>For he had heard that
they would deliver the hold unto them that took Demetrius’ part;
wherefore he set a garrison there to keep it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,35);</script>After this came
Jonathan home again, and calling the elders of the people together, he
consulted with them about building strong holds in Judea,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,36);</script>And making the walls
of Jerusalem higher, and raising a great mount between the tower and the
city, for to separate it from the city, that so it might be alone, that
men might neither sell nor buy in it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,37);</script>Upon this they came
together to build up the city, forasmuch as part of the wall toward the
brook on the east side was fallen down, and they repaired that which was
called Caphenatha.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,38);</script>Simon also set up
Adida in Sephela, and made it strong with gates and bars.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,39);</script>Now Tryphon went
about to get the kingdom of Asia, and to kill Antiochus the king, that he
might set the crown upon his own head.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,40);</script>Howbeit he was afraid
that Jonathan would not suffer him, and that he would fight against him;
wherefore he sought a way how to take Jonathan, that he might kill him. So
he removed, and came to Bethsan.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,41);</script>Then Jonathan went
out to meet him with forty thousand men chosen for the battle, and came to
Bethsan.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,42);</script>Now when Tryphon saw
Jonathan came with so great a force, he durst not stretch his hand against
him;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,43);</script>But received him
honourably, and commended him unto all his friends, and gave him gifts,
and commanded his men of war to be as obedient unto him, as to himself.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,44);</script>Unto Jonathan also he
said, Why hast thou brought all this people to so great trouble, seeing
there is no war betwixt us?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,45);</script>Therefore send them
now home again, and choose a few men to wait on thee, and come thou with
me to Ptolemais, for I will give it thee, and the rest of the strong holds
and forces, and all that have any charge: as for me, I will return and
depart: for this is the cause of my coming.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,46);</script>So Jonathan believing
him did as he bade him, and sent away his host, who went into the land of
Judea.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,47);</script>And with himself he
retained but three thousand men, of whom he sent two thousand into
Galilee, and one thousand went with him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,48);</script>Now as soon as
Jonathan entered into Ptolemais, they of Ptolemais shut the gates and took
him, and all them that came with him they slew with the sword.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,49);</script>Then sent Tryphon an
host of footmen and horsemen into Galilee, and into the great plain, to
destroy all Jonathan’s company.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,50);</script>But when they knew
that Jonathan and they that were with him were taken and slain, they
encouraged one another; and went close together, prepared to fight.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,51);</script>They therefore that
followed upon them, perceiving that they were ready to fight for their
lives, turned back again.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,52);</script>Whereupon they all
came into the land of Judea peaceably, and there they bewailed Jonathan,
and them that were with him, and they were sore afraid; wherefore all
Israel made great lamentation.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,53);</script>Then all the heathen
that were round about then sought to destroy them: for said they, They
have no captain, nor any to help them: now therefore let us make war upon
them, and take away their memorial from among men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,1);</script>Now when Simon heard
that Tryphon had gathered together a great host to invade the land of
Judea, and destroy it,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,2);</script>And saw that the
people was in great trembling and fear, he went up to Jerusalem, and
gathered the people together,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,3);</script>And gave them
exhortation, saying, Ye yourselves know what great things I, and my
brethren, and my father’s house, have done for the laws and the
sanctuary, the battles also and troubles which we have seen.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,4);</script>By reason whereof all
my brethren are slain for Israel’s sake, and I am left alone.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,5);</script>Now therefore be it
far from me, that I should spare mine own life in any time of trouble: for
I am no better than my brethren.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,6);</script>Doubtless I will
avenge my nation, and the sanctuary, and our wives, and our children: for
all the heathen are gathered to destroy us of very malice.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,7);</script>Now as soon as the
people heard these words, their spirit revived.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,8);</script>And they answered with
a loud voice, saying, Thou shalt be our leader instead of Judas and
Jonathan thy brother.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,9);</script>Fight thou our
battles, and whatsoever, thou commandest us, that will we do.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,10);</script>So then he gathered
together all the men of war, and made haste to finish the walls of
Jerusalem, and he fortified it round about.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,11);</script>Also he sent Jonathan
the son of Absolom, and with him a great power, to Joppa: who casting out
them that were therein remained there in it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,12);</script>So Tryphon removed
from Ptolemaus with a great power to invade the land of Judea, and
Jonathan was with him in ward.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,13);</script>But Simon pitched his
tents at Adida, over against the plain.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,14);</script>Now when Tryphon knew
that Simon was risen up instead of his brother Jonathan, and meant to join
battle with him, he sent messengers unto him, saying,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,15);</script>Whereas we have
Jonathan thy brother in hold, it is for money that he is owing unto the
king’s treasure, concerning the business that was committed unto him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,16);</script>Wherefore now send an
hundred talents of silver, and two of his sons for hostages, that when he
is at liberty he may not revolt from us, and we will let him go.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,17);</script>Hereupon Simon,
albeit he perceived that they spake deceitfully unto him yet sent he the
money and the children, lest peradventure he should procure to himself
great hatred of the people:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,18);</script>Who might have said,
Because I sent him not the money and the children, therefore is Jonathan
dead.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,19);</script>So he sent them the
children and the hundred talents: howbeit Tryphon dissembled neither would
he let Jonathan go.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,20);</script>And after this came
Tryphon to invade the land, and destroy it, going round about by the way
that leadeth unto Adora: but Simon and his host marched against him in
every place, wheresoever he went.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,21);</script>Now they that were in
the tower sent messengers unto Tryphon, to the end that he should hasten
his coming unto them by the wilderness, and send them victuals.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,22);</script>Wherefore Tryphon
made ready all his horsemen to come that night: but there fell a very
great snow, by reason whereof he came not. So he departed, and came into
the country of Galaad.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,23);</script>And when he came near
to Bascama he slew Jonathan, who was buried there.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,24);</script>Afterward Tryphon
returned and went into his own land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,25);</script>Then sent Simon, and
took the bones of Jonathan his brother, and buried them in Modin, the city
of his fathers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,26);</script>And all Israel made
great lamentation for him, and bewailed him many days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,27);</script>Simon also built a
monument upon the sepulchre of his father and his brethren, and raised it
aloft to the sight, with hewn stone behind and before.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,28);</script>Moreover he set up
seven pyramids, one against another, for his father, and his mother, and
his four brethren.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,29);</script>And in these he made
cunning devices, about the which he set great pillars, and upon the
pillars he made all their armour for a perpetual memory, and by the armour
ships carved, that they might be seen of all that sail on the sea.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,30);</script>This is the sepulchre
which he made at Modin, and it standeth yet unto this day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,31);</script>Now Tryphon dealt
deceitfully with the young king Antiochus, and slew him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,32);</script>And he reigned in his
stead, and crowned himself king of Asia, and brought a great calamity upon
the land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,33);</script>Then Simon built up
the strong holds in Judea, and fenced them about with high towers, and
great walls, and gates, and bars, and laid up victuals therein.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,34);</script>Moreover Simon chose
men, and sent to king Demetrius, to the end he should give the land an
immunity, because all that Tryphon did was to spoil.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,35);</script>Unto whom king
Demetrius answered and wrote after this manner:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,36);</script>King Demetrius unto
Simon the high priest, and friend of kings, as also unto the elders and
nation of the Jews, sendeth greeting:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,37);</script>The golden crown, and
the scarlet robe, which ye sent unto us, we have received: and we are
ready to make a stedfast peace with you, yea, and to write unto our
officers, to confirm the immunities which we have granted.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,38);</script>And whatsoever
covenants we have made with you shall stand; and the strong holds, which
ye have builded, shall be your own.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,39);</script>As for any oversight
or fault committed unto this day, we forgive it, and the crown tax also,
which ye owe us: and if there were any other tribute paid in Jerusalem, it
shall no more be paid.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,40);</script>And look who are meet
among you to be in our court, let then be enrolled, and let there be peace
betwixt us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,41);</script>Thus the yoke of the
heathen was taken away from Israel in the hundred and seventieth year.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,42);</script>Then the people of
Israel began to write in their instruments and contracts, In the first
year of Simon the high priest, the governor and leader of the Jews.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,43);</script>In those days Simon
camped against Gaza and besieged it round about; he made also an engine of
war, and set it by the city, and battered a certain tower, and took it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,44);</script>And they that were in
the engine leaped into the city; whereupon there was a great uproar in the
city:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,45);</script>Insomuch as the
people of the city rent their clothes, and climbed upon the walls with
their wives and children, and cried with a loud voice, beseeching Simon to
grant them peace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,46);</script>And they said, Deal
not with us according to our wickedness, but according to thy mercy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,47);</script>So Simon was appeased
toward them, and fought no more against them, but put them out of the
city, and cleansed the houses wherein the idols were, and so entered into
it with songs and thanksgiving.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,48);</script>Yea, he put all
uncleanness out of it, and placed such men there as would keep the law,
and made it stronger than it was before, and built therein a dwellingplace
for himself.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,49);</script>They also of the
tower in Jerusalem were kept so strait, that they could neither come
forth, nor go into the country, nor buy, nor sell: wherefore they were in
great distress for want of victuals, and a great number of them perished
through famine.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,50);</script>Then cried they to
Simon, beseeching him to be at one with them: which thing he granted them;
and when he had put them out from thence, he cleansed the tower from
pollutions:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,51);</script>And entered into it
the three and twentieth day of the second month in the hundred seventy and
first year, with thanksgiving, and branches of palm trees, and with harps,
and cymbals, and with viols, and hymns, and songs: because there was
destroyed a great enemy out of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,52);</script>He ordained also that
that day should be kept every year with gladness. Moreover the hill of the
temple that was by the tower he made stronger than it was, and there he
dwelt himself with his company.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,53);</script>And when Simon saw
that John his son was a valiant man, he made him captain of all the hosts;
and he dwelt in Gazera.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,1);</script>Now in the hundred
threescore and twelfth year king Demetrius gathered his forces together,
and went into Media to get him help to fight against Tryphone.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,2);</script>But when Arsaces, the
king of Persia and Media, heard that Demetrius was entered within his
borders, he sent one of his princes to take him alive:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,3);</script>Who went and smote the
host of Demetrius, and took him, and brought him to Arsaces, by whom he
was put in ward.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,4);</script>As for the land of
Judea, that was quiet all the days of Simon; for he sought the good of his
nation in such wise, as that evermore his authority and honour pleased
them well.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>And as he was
honourable in all his acts, so in this, that he took Joppa for an haven,
and made an entrance to the isles of the sea,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>And enlarged the
bounds of his nation, and recovered the country,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,7);</script>And gathered together
a great number of captives, and had the dominion of Gazera, and Bethsura,
and the tower, out of the which he took all uncleaness, neither was there
any that resisted him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,8);</script>Then did they till
their ground in peace, and the earth gave her increase, and the trees of
the field their fruit.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,9);</script>The ancient men sat
all in the streets, communing together of good things, and the young men
put on glorious and warlike apparel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,10);</script>He provided victuals
for the cities, and set in them all manner of munition, so that his
honourable name was renowned unto the end of the world.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,11);</script>He made peace in the
land, and Israel rejoiced with great joy:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,12);</script>For every man sat
under his vine and his fig tree, and there was none to fray them:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,13);</script>Neither was there any
left in the land to fight against them: yea, the kings themselves were
overthrown in those days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,14);</script>Moreover he
strengthened all those of his people that were brought low: the law he
searched out; and every contemner of the law and wicked person he took
away.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,15);</script>He beautified the
sanctuary, and multiplied vessels of the temple.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,16);</script>Now when it was heard
at Rome, and as far as Sparta, that Jonathan was dead, they were very
sorry.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,17);</script>But as soon as they
heard that his brother Simon was made high priest in his stead, and ruled
the country, and the cities therein:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,18);</script>They wrote unto him
in tables of brass, to renew the friendship and league which they had made
with Judas and Jonathan his brethren:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,19);</script>Which writings were
read before the congregation at Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,20);</script>And this is the copy
of the letters that the Lacedemonians sent; The rulers of the
Lacedemonians, with the city, unto Simon the high priest, and the elders,
and priests, and residue of the people of the Jews, our brethren, send
greeting:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,21);</script>The ambassadors that
were sent unto our people certified us of your glory and honour: wherefore
we were glad of their coming,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,22);</script>And did register the
things that they spake in the council of the people in this manner;
Numenius son of Antiochus, and Antipater son of Jason, the Jews’
ambassadors, came unto us to renew the friendship they had with us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,23);</script>And it pleased the
people to entertain the men honourably, and to put the copy of their
ambassage in publick records, to the end the people of the Lacedemonians
might have a memorial thereof: furthermore we have written a copy thereof
unto Simon the high priest.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,24);</script>After this Simon sent
Numenius to Rome with a great shield of gold of a thousand pound weight to
confirm the league with them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,25);</script>Whereof when the
people heard, they said, What thanks shall we give to Simon and his sons?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,26);</script>For he and his
brethren and the house of his father have established Israel, and chased
away in fight their enemies from them, and confirmed their liberty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,27);</script>So then they wrote it
in tables of brass, which they set upon pillars in mount Sion: and this is
the copy of the writing; The eighteenth day of the month Elul, in the
hundred threescore and twelfth year, being the third year of Simon the
high priest,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,28);</script>At Saramel in the
great congregation of the priests, and people, and rulers of the nation,
and elders of the country, were these things notified unto us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,29);</script>Forasmuch as
oftentimes there have been wars in the country, wherein for the
maintenance of their sanctuary, and the law, Simon the son of Mattathias,
of the posterity of Jarib, together with his brethren, put themselves in
jeopardy, and resisting the enemies of their nation did their nation great
honour:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,30);</script>(For after that
Jonathan, having gathered his nation together, and been their high priest,
was added to his people,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,31);</script>Their enemies
prepared to invade their country, that they might destroy it, and lay
hands on the sanctuary:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,32);</script>At which time Simon
rose up, and fought for his nation, and spent much of his own substance,
and armed the valiant men of his nation and gave them wages,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,33);</script>And fortified the
cities of Judea, together with Bethsura, that lieth upon the borders of
Judea, where the armour of the enemies had been before; but he set a
garrison of Jews there:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,34);</script>Moreover he fortified
Joppa, which lieth upon the sea, and Gazera, that bordereth upon Azotus,
where the enemies had dwelt before: but he placed Jews there, and
furnished them with all things convenient for the reparation thereof.)
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,35);</script>The people therefore
sang the acts of Simon, and unto what glory he thought to bring his
nation, made him their governor and chief priest, because he had done all
these things, and for the justice and faith which he kept to his nation,
and for that he sought by all means to exalt his people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,36);</script>For in his time
things prospered in his hands, so that the heathen were taken out of their
country, and they also that were in the city of David in Jerusalem, who
had made themselves a tower, out of which they issued, and polluted all
about the sanctuary, and did much hurt in the holy place:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,37);</script>But he placed Jews
therein. and fortified it for the safety of the country and the city, and
raised up the walls of Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,38);</script>King Demetrius also
confirmed him in the high priesthood according to those things,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,39);</script>And made him one of
his friends, and honoured him with great honour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,40);</script>For he had heard say,
that the Romans had called the Jews their friends and confederates and
brethren; and that they had entertained the ambassadors of Simon
honourably;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,41);</script>Also that the Jews
and priests were well pleased that Simon should be their governor and high
priest for ever, until there should arise a faithful prophet;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,42);</script>Moreover that he
should be their captain, and should take charge of the sanctuary, to set
them over their works, and over the country, and over the armour, and over
the fortresses, that, I say, he should take charge of the sanctuary;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,43);</script>Beside this, that he
should be obeyed of every man, and that all the writings in the country
should be made in his name, and that he should be clothed in purple, and
wear gold:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,44);</script>Also that it should
be lawful for none of the people or priests to break any of these things,
or to gainsay his words, or to gather an assembly in the country without
him, or to be clothed in purple, or wear a buckle of gold;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,45);</script>And whosoever should
do otherwise, or break any of these things, he should be punished.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,46);</script>Thus it liked all the
people to deal with Simon, and to do as hath been said.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,47);</script>Then Simon accepted
hereof, and was well pleased to be high priest, and captain and governor
of the Jews and priests, and to defend them all.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,48);</script>So they commanded
that this writing should be put in tables of brass, and that they should
be set up within the compass of the sanctuary in a conspicuous place;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,49);</script>Also that the copies
thereof should be laid up in the treasury, to the end that Simon and his
sons might have them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,1);</script>Moreover Antiochus son
of Demetrius the king sent letters from the isles of the sea unto Simon
the priest and prince of the Jews, and to all the people;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,2);</script>The contents whereof
were these: King Antiochus to Simon the high priest and prince of his
nation, and to the people of the Jews, greeting:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,3);</script>Forasmuch as certain
pestilent men have usurped the kingdom of our fathers, and my purpose is
to challenge it again, that I may restore it to the old estate, and to
that end have gathered a multitude of foreign soldiers together, and
prepared ships of war;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,4);</script>My meaning also being
to go through the country, that I may be avenged of them that have
destroyed it, and made many cities in the kingdom desolate:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,5);</script>Now therefore I
confirm unto thee all the oblations which the kings before me granted
thee, and whatsoever gifts besides they granted.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,6);</script>I give thee leave also
to coin money for thy country with thine own stamp.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,7);</script>And as concerning
Jerusalem and the sanctuary, let them be free; and all the armour that
thou hast made, and fortresses that thou hast built, and keepest in thine
hands, let them remain unto thee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,8);</script>And if anything be, or
shall be, owing to the king, let it be forgiven thee from this time forth
for evermore.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,9);</script>Furthermore, when we
have obtained our kingdom, we will honour thee, and thy nation, and thy
temple, with great honour, so that your honour shall be known throughout
the world.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,10);</script>In the hundred
threescore and fourteenth year went Antiochus into the land of his
fathers: at which time all the forces came together unto him, so that few
were left with Tryphon.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,11);</script>Wherefore being
pursued by king Antiochus, he fled unto Dora, which lieth by the sea side:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,12);</script>For he saw that
troubles came upon him all at once, and that his forces had forsaken him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,13);</script>Then camped Antiochus
against Dora, having with him an hundred and twenty thousand men of war,
and eight thousand horsemen.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,14);</script>And when he had
compassed the city round about, and joined ships close to the town on the
sea side, he vexed the city by land and by sea, neither suffered he any to
go out or in.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,15);</script>In the mean season
came Numenius and his company from Rome, having letters to the kings and
countries; wherein were written these things:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,16);</script>Lucius, consul of the
Romans unto king Ptolemee, greeting:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,17);</script>The Jews’
ambassadors, our friends and confederates, came unto us to renew the old
friendship and league, being sent from Simon the high priest, and from the
people of the Jews:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,18);</script>And they brought a
shield of gold of a thousand pound.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,19);</script>We thought it good
therefore to write unto the kings and countries, that they should do them
no harm, nor fight against them, their cities, or countries, nor yet aid
their enemies against them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,20);</script>It seemed also good
to us to receive the shield of them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,21);</script>If therefore there be
any pestilent fellows, that have fled from their country unto you, deliver
them unto Simon the high priest, that he may punish them according to
their own law.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,22);</script>The same things wrote
he likewise unto Demetrius the king, and Attalus, to Ariarathes, and
Arsaces,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,23);</script>And to all the
countries and to Sampsames, and the Lacedemonians, and to Delus, and
Myndus, and Sicyon, and Caria, and Samos, and Pamphylia, and Lycia, and
Halicarnassus, and Rhodus, and Aradus, and Cos, and Side, and Aradus, and
Gortyna, and Cnidus, and Cyprus, and Cyrene.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,24);</script>And the copy hereof
they wrote to Simon the high priest.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,25);</script>So Antiochus the king
camped against Dora the second day, assaulting it continually, and making
engines, by which means he shut up Tryphon, that he could neither go out
nor in.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,26);</script>At that time Simon
sent him two thousand chosen men to aid him; silver also, and gold, and
much armour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,27);</script>Nevertheless he would
not receive them, but brake all the covenants which he had made with him
afore, and became strange unto him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,28);</script>Furthermore he sent
unto him Athenobius, one of his friends, to commune with him, and say, Ye
withhold Joppa and Gazera; with the tower that is in Jerusalem, which are
cities of my realm.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,29);</script>The borders thereof
ye have wasted, and done great hurt in the land, and got the dominion of
many places within my kingdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,30);</script>Now therefore deliver
the cities which ye have taken, and the tributes of the places, whereof ye
have gotten dominion without the borders of Judea:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,31);</script>Or else give me for
them five hundred talents of silver; and for the harm that ye have done,
and the tributes of the cities, other five hundred talents: if not, we
will come and fight against you
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,32);</script>So Athenobius the
king’s friend came to Jerusalem: and when he saw the glory of Simon, and
the cupboard of gold and silver plate, and his great attendance, he was
astonished, and told him the king’s message.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,33);</script>Then answered Simon,
and said unto him, We have neither taken other men’s land, nor holden
that which appertaineth to others, but the inheritance of our fathers,
which our enemies had wrongfully in possession a certain time.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,34);</script>Wherefore we, having
opportunity, hold the inheritance of our fathers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,35);</script>And whereas thou
demandest Joppa and Gazera, albeit they did great harm unto the people in
our country, yet will we give thee an hundred talents for them. Hereunto
Athenobius answered him not a word;
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,36);</script>But returned in a
rage to the king, and made report unto him of these speeches, and of the
glory of Simon, and of all that he had seen: whereupon the king was
exceeding wroth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,37);</script>In the mean time fled
Tryphon by ship unto Orthosias.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,38);</script>Then the king made
Cendebeus captain of the sea coast, and gave him an host of footmen and
horsemen,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,39);</script>And commanded him to
remove his host toward Judea; also he commanded him to build up Cedron,
and to fortify the gates, and to war against the people; but as for the
king himself, he pursued Tryphon.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,40);</script>So Cendebeus came to
Jamnia and began to provoke the people and to invade Judea, and to take
the people prisoners, and slay them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,41);</script>And when he had built
up Cedrou, he set horsemen there, and an host of footmen, to the end that
issuing out they might make outroads upon the ways of Judea, as the king
had commanded him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,1);</script>Then came up John from
Gazera, and told Simon his father what Cendebeus had done.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,2);</script>Wherefore Simon called
his two eldest sons, Judas and John, and said unto them, I, and my
brethren, and my father’s house, have ever from my youth unto this day
fought against the enemies of Israel; and things have prospered so well in
our hands, that we have delivered Israel oftentimes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,3);</script>But now I am old, and
ye, by God’s mercy, are of a sufficient age: be ye instead of me and my
brother, and go and fight for our nation, and the help from heaven be with
you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,4);</script>So he chose out of the
country twenty thousand men of war with horsemen, who went out against
Cendebeus, and rested that night at Modin.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,5);</script>And when as they rose
in the morning, and went into the plain, behold, a mighty great host both
of footmen and horsemen came against them: howbeit there was a water brook
betwixt them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,6);</script>So he and his people
pitched over against them: and when he saw that the people were afraid to
go over the water brook, he went first over himself, and then the men
seeing him passed through after him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,7);</script>That done, he divided
his men, and set the horsemen in the midst of the footmen: for the
enemies’ horsemen were very many.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,8);</script>Then sounded they with
the holy trumpets: whereupon Cendebeus and his host were put to flight, so
that many of them were slain, and the remnant gat them to the strong hold.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,9);</script>At that time was Judas
John’s brother wounded; but John still followed after them, until he
came to Cedron, which Cendebeus had built.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,10);</script>So they fled even
unto the towers in the fields of Azotus; wherefore he burned it with fire:
so that there were slain of them about two thousand men. Afterward he
returned into the land of Judea in peace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,11);</script>Moreover in the plain
of Jericho was Ptolemeus the son of Abubus made captain, and he had
abundance of silver and gold:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,12);</script>For he was the high
priest’s son in law.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,13);</script>Wherefore his heart
being lifted up, he thought to get the country to himself, and thereupon
consulted deceitfully against Simon and his sons to destroy them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,14);</script>Now Simon was
visiting the cities that were in the country, and taking care for the good
ordering of them; at which time he came down himself to Jericho with his
sons, Mattathias and Judas, in the hundred threescore and seventeenth
year, in the eleventh month, called Sabat:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,15);</script>Where the son of
Abubus receiving them deceitfully into a little hold, called Docus, which
he had built, made them a great banquet: howbeit he had hid men there.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,16);</script>So when Simon and his
sons had drunk largely, Ptolemee and his men rose up, and took their
weapons, and came upon Simon into the banqueting place, and slew him, and
his two sons, and certain of his servants.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,17);</script>In which doing he
committed a great treachery, and recompensed evil for good.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,18);</script>Then Ptolemee wrote
these things, and sent to the king, that he should send him an host to aid
him, and he would deliver him the country and cities.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,19);</script>He sent others also
to Gazera to kill John: and unto the tribunes he sent letters to come unto
him, that he might give them silver, and gold, and rewards.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,20);</script>And others he sent to
take Jerusalem, and the mountain of the temple.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,21);</script>Now one had run afore
to Gazera and told John that his father and brethren were slain, and,
quoth he, Ptolemee hath sent to slay thee also.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,22);</script>Hereof when he heard,
he was sore astonished: so he laid hands on them that were come to destroy
him, and slew them; for he knew that they sought to make him away.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,23);</script>As concerning the
rest of the acts of John, and his wars, and worthy deeds which he did, and
the building of the walls which he made, and his doings,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,24);</script>Behold, these are
written in the chronicles of his priesthood, from the time he was made
high priest after his father.
